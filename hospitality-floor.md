We've arranged a floor for people who want to hold private gatherings in their sleeping rooms. On this floor, everyone promises to tolerate noise and not issue noise complaints against each other.

- Don't call the hotel to ask for the hospitality floor. They don't have a special block set aside for it, we're just assigning the rooms ourselves.
- Book a regular reservation for now. We will convert reservations over to the Hospitality Floor at a later time.
- By asking for this, you promise to us and all your floor-mates that you can sleep through the noise, and you won't call in with noise complaints.

There are limitations to keep in mind:

- The floor right above the hospitality floor is expected to be the only smoking floor in the hotel, so there will be some regular hotel guests above your heads. This will probably not be an issue next year, but it is this year. If you smoke and don't mind a little noise, please book a smoking room so we can fill that floor with our congoers instead of regular guests.
- Subwoofers are not allowed at all this year, because of the general guests in the smoking floor directly above.
- Being on the hospitality floor makes it *less* likely for you to get a noise complaint, but it's not a guarantee; noise still travels through floors and ceilings.
- It's still *your* sleeping room, so *you* are responsible for any damages. Don't let your gatherings get out of hand.
- *You* are responsible if anyone underage is found in your room with alcohol, or if anyone at all is found in your room with illegal drugs. It doesn't matter where they got them from.
- Make a good impression: If you see any mess in the hall, *clean it up,* even if the mess isn't your fault.
- You should be able to talk in your room without yelling. If you have to yell, your room is getting too loud. Keep music below yelling volume too.
- Quiet it down a bit more after midnight.
- If hotel security or FLARE tells you to tone it down, do so immediately.
- Seriously, don't start a howl. Yelling and screaming is the quickest way to noise complaints. Save that racket for inside convention hangout space.
- There will be a person checking for con badges at the entry to the floor from 7pm to 3am. **Everybody in your room must have a con badge.**

By gathering together the conversation noise in one place, we reduce how many noise complaints are created, and the hotel likes that. But if you go overboard, you can still get your room gatherings, and perhaps the entire floor, shut down. **KEEP. IT. REASONABLE.**
