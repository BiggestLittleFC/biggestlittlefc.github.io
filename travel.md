## Travel Via Megabus

Megabus provides service from both San Francisco, CA and Sacramento, CA that drops off three blocks away from the downtown bus station.

Walk to the bus station (3 blocks) and catch bus number 14 (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.rtcwashoe.com/">schedule</a>).

Megabus service starts at just $1 each way, and increases as the bus gets more sold out.

When booking a Megabus ticket, select the destination as "Reno, NV."

The evening Megabus arrival (9:05pm) only allows 10 minutes to walk to the bus station and catch bus 14 (9:15pm). Walk fast. If Megabus is even a few minutes late arriving in Reno in the evening, you will likely have to wait a full hour for the next #14. If that happens, a taxi should be about $20.

**Warning for fursuiters**: Megabus only allows a single 62-inch piece of luggage (same standard as airline luggage check), plus a small carryon (backpack or smaller). Make sure you can fit within their baggage limits before booking a bus ticket.

## International Travel

The Reno/Tahoe airport does not typically accept international flights. If you're flying in from outside the United States, check on the price of flying into San Francisco (SFO) or Sacramento (SMF) and using Megabus.

Also check if you know any friends who are driving in from bigger cities, and consider if it's cheaper to fly into their city and share the car trip with them.
