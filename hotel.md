## Book A Room

The hotel booking link will appear below. Please don't mash the refresh button on your browser; we've tested the auto-refresh very thoroughly.
For an even faster experience, use <a target="_blank" href="https://api.goblfc.org/hotel.php">this stripped-down page instead.</a>

<iframe style="border:none;height:75px;width:100%;" src="https://api.goblfc.org/hotel.php?iframe=true"></iframe>


- **Tip: during the initial booking rush, book your room for just yourself, and after confirmation, edit it to add roommates.**
- You will be charged a **deposit** for the first night when you book, which is **refunded** if you cancel the room later.
- Your credit/debit card must have an expiration date AFTER the con.
- To book by phone, call {{ page.hotelphone }} and use the booking code that reveals with the booking link above.
- To book a suite, book by phone and give them our booking code. Suites in the Summit level are discounted 25%. Suites in the A Hotel are not discounted this year.
- If you want a suite, book a regular room first during the initial rush, then call to have them convert it to a suite. That way you still have something if the suites are full.
- If you want to be on the Hospitality Floor, book a regular room when booking opens, and we will assign you to that floor in a separate process.
- If you smoke, and can tolerate some noise from the Hospitality Floor: get your reservation done as quick as you can, then edit your reservation to request a smoking floor. It helps us have less non-con guests on that floor.

## Room Types

Rooms also require a $25 resort fee which pays for wireless internet, an airport shuttle (runs every half hour), parking, bottled water in your room (refreshed daily). The resort fee (plus tax) is charged separately when you check in.

### The Summit at Grand Sierra

Remodeled in 2013. Rooms on higher floors. Rooms have fridges and microwaves.

- 3 days: ${{ page.prices.basic3 }} per night, plus taxes and fees
- 4 days: ${{ page.prices.basic4 }} per night, plus taxes and fees
- 5 days: ${{ page.prices.basic5 }} per night, plus taxes and fees

### The "A" Hotel

Remodeled in 2017. Rooms now have fridges, after the remodel.

- 3 days: ${{ page.prices.premium3 }} per night, plus taxes and fees
- 4 days: ${{ page.prices.premium4 }} per night, plus taxes and fees
- 5 days: ${{ page.prices.premium5 }} per night, plus taxes and fees

Prices shown are based on average per-night cost. Taxes and fees apply: Add $25/night resort fee, $2/night tourism fee, and 13% tax.
Automated emails may mention a charge for 3rd and 4th roommates, but those are waived if you book in our block.

<div class="accordion-list">

**Debit Card Users**\: please click here to read this
: The hotel holds an extra $50/night from your card when you check in. If you check in using a debit card, this will reduce your available balance. It may take as many as 10 days after checkout to be returned to your account; your bank controls that, not the hotel.
  Tip\: if you're eating in on-site restaurants, charge to your room to utilize this tied-up money.

## "Hospitality Floor"

We've arranged a floor for people who want to hold private gatherings in their sleeping rooms. On this floor, everyone promises to tolerate noise and not issue noise complaints against each other.

- Don't call the hotel to ask for the hospitality floor. They don't have a special block set aside for it, we're just assigning the rooms ourselves.
- Book a regular reservation for now. We will convert reservations over to the Hospitality Floor at a later time.
- By asking for this, you promise to us and all your floor-mates that you can sleep through the noise, and you won't call in with noise complaints.

There are limitations to keep in mind:

- The floor right above the hospitality floor is expected to be the only smoking floor in the hotel, so there will be some regular hotel guests above your heads. This will probably not be an issue next year, but it is this year. If you smoke and don't mind a little noise, please book a smoking room so we can fill that floor with our congoers instead of regular guests.
- Subwoofers are not allowed at all this year, because of the general guests in the smoking floor directly above.
- Being on the hospitality floor makes it *less* likely for you to get a noise complaint, but it's not a guarantee; noise still travels through floors and ceilings.
- It's still *your* sleeping room, so *you* are responsible for any damages. Don't let your gatherings get out of hand.
- Make a good impression: If you see any mess in the hall, *clean it up,* even if the mess isn't your fault.
- You should be able to talk in your room without yelling. If you have to yell, your room is getting too loud. Keep music below yelling volume too.
- Quiet it down a bit more after midnight.
- If hotel security or FLARE tells you to tone it down, do so immediately.
- Seriously, don't start a howl. Yelling and screaming is the quickest way to noise complaints. Save that racket for inside convention hangout space.
- There will be a person checking for con badges at the entry to the floor from 7pm to 3am. **Everybody in your room must have a con badge.**

By gathering together the conversation noise in one place, we reduce how many noise complaints are created, and the hotel likes that. But if you go overboard, you can still get your room gatherings, and perhaps the entire floor, shut down. **KEEP. IT. REASONABLE.**




## Additional Information

<div class="accordion-list">

<!--The block is full; where do I book a room?
: Our block is sold out, but the hotel still has rooms. We recommend you <a href="http://rooms.grandsierraresort.com" target="_blank">book a general-priced room using the GSR website</a>. There are no shuttle services to other hotels. There is <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Baymont+Inn+and+Suites+Reno/@39.5214178,-119.7871447,15.75z/data=!4m8!3m7!1s0x0:0xd92b572278d291d6!5m2!1s2017-06-01!2i4!8m2!3d39.5197985!4d-119.7870469">one small motel within walking distance</a>; it is not an official overflow and is not making any special arrangements for our attendees.-->

What is the Resort Fee?
: This hotel charges a resort fee in addition to your room rate, which pays for the airport shuttle, parking, pool, gym, internet, and free bottled water.

What is the Tourism Fee?
: A fee mandated by the City of Reno for all hotels, instituted in 2015.

Is there a 'party floor?'
: The closest equivalent is the <a href="#hospitality">hospitality floor</a>. We will open applications for the hospitality floor at a later date.

Check in/out times?
: Check in after 3PM. Check out by 11AM.

I require two beds.
: Write "2 beds" in the requests section. Or declare 4 people in the room. We recommend doing both.

How many rooms?
: The hotel has 2,000 rooms. Our block has about 1200.

I want to room next to my friends.
: After booking online, just call the hotel with the confirmation numbers and ask to be placed together.

What's the best way to bring in my luggage?
: You may not use the front entrance as a loading zone, and you may not use the bell carts. Please park in self-parking, and then hand carry your luggage to your room. We recommend bringing your own folding cart.
  Or, you can park in the front entrance, and leave it up to the valet parking and bellmen to move your car and luggage. Last we checked, there was no official fee for this service, but tips are expected.

Can I pre-pay for my room?
: Yes, just call the hotel with your confirmation number.
