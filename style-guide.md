## Theme Styles

### Color Palette

**PURPLE.** Purple is this year’s theme color, overusing purple is great! Don’t be afraid to let the background carry this color and don’t be afraid to push “purple” in a different ambient color to fit your image better.

### Font

Please use the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans" target="blank">Josefin Sans</a> font for the text in your work.

Use either the Regular or Bold Italic flavor depending on the context.

## World & Setting Information

The musical takes place in a world where everyone is already an anthropomorphic character. Some of these characters have "Fursonas" of other animals that they feel better matches their personality or they identify with.  These people hold conventions to get together with other people who have Fursonas or are just fans of a lot of the art. The world is basically the same as ours, and at a convention like ours.  You will see lots of characters in fursuits just like during BLFC along with the hotel and casino settings, though everyone who isn't in a fursuit, "Furry" or not, is an anthropomorphic character.  

Our story takes place at one of these conventions.

## Character Information

### Thistle 

**Played by: Levi Jackson** A dog who's fursona is a rabbit.  Young adult.  Works a job in a clothing store to pay the bills, but has no love for it.  Lives on the east coast, far away from Clover and Sahny.  Very schedule oriented.  This convention is his first, and he is excited and nervous.  Also very excited to meet Clover in person for the first time.  He is constantly looking at his phone to check his schedule and revises it constantly before arriving.  He relies on his phone a lot, consequently, he always has it with him and is nervous when he is disconnected or gets no signal with it, or it is at risk of dying.

**Played by: Jesse Dook** A bear who's fursona is an eagle.  Adult.  Calm and collected.  He used to volunteer at cons, but stopped because he wasn't getting joy out of it anymore.  Helpful in nature, he's like a gentle giant.  He also tends to make sure everyone in a crowd is OK and taken care of.  Prefers his drama to be on TV instead of in his life, and tends to avoid it.
