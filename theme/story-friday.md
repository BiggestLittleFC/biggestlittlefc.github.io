<p>SUPERIMPOSE: "Friday"</p>
<p>FADE IN:</p>

<a name="scene1"></a>
<h3>INT. THE GUEST ROOM - DAY</h3>

<p>Daylight pours in around the cracked curtains. There's a mess of bedsheets in an empty bed by the window. On the other bed with Thistle's footpaw sticks out of a twisted wreck of pillows and bedding. Thistle groans while stirring awake. His arm stretches out of the blanket heap with a muffled yawn. He pauses. Then, with flailing kicks he rushes upright. Grabs the clock that flashes "12:25".  His face fills with panic.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>What?!</p>
</div>

<p>Scrambling to untangle himself from the sheets, he falls face-first out of bed. He leaps to his feet and searches the room in a hurry.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(muttering)</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no, no!</p>
</div>

<p>With the blanket still wrapped around his midsection, he grabs his pants from the floor, and pulls his phone from the pocket.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(muttering)</p>
<p>Oh! Why didn't you wake me?!</p>
</div>

<p>He tries the power button several times to no screen, then shakes the phone.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Ugggh! I'm late! I'm late! I'm late for a very important... panel.</p>
</div>

<p>The electronic door latch whirs and clicks. Clover steps into the room carrying a plastic bag, closing the door behind him. Clover lifts the bag.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>I brought you food and-- err, I oh, sorry. Sorry!</p>
</div>

<p>Clover tries to avert his gaze as he hands the bag to Thistle, who in his underwear frantically trying to put on his pants.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(anxious)</p>
<p>You're here! My phone died! Ugh! I'm late! Everything is falling apart!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa! What? Come on, it's not that late.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover glances at the clock on the middle nightstand</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(reassuringly)</p>
<p>Ah, the power must have gone out. Look, I got you food and another shirt from Baz. We can eat, get your badge, and make it down just in time for opening ceremonies.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(calming down)</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Yeah. Here.</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle sniffs the air as Clover presents a nondescript, take-out box and places another "Good Boix" shirt on top of it. Thistle accepts it, wagging his tail.</p>


<a name="scene2"></a>
<h3>INT. CON SPACE - DAY</h3>

<h3>HALLWAY</h3>

<p>Thistle walks alongside Clover as he fidgets with his new con badge pinned to his shirt. Clover lunges ahead and opens the door to the main stage, he makes a sweeping gesture towards the opening. Thistle smiles bashfully and tucks through the doorway.</p>


<h3>MAIN STAGE</h3>

<p>Thistle and Clover join a crowd, they spread out into a huge room with a gaudy, crystal chandelier. More and more people fill the room. Along the sides, several people sit with water bottles, while staring at their phones. The front is densely packed. Up on stage, big, purple, silky curtains shimmer in the bright stage lights. Stage left, a figure peeks at the crowd through the shroud.</p>


<h3>BACK STAGE</h3>

<p>Diego peers past the stage. His wire hair tail stands tense through his violet tail coat &amp; slacks. He steps back, takes a deep breath, adjusts his lavalier mic, breathes out sharply, and snaps the fingers on both his hands simultaneously, then points forward.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(to himself)</p>
<p>You got this!</p>
</div>

<a name="scene3"></a>

<h3>MAIN STAGE</h3>

<p>He walks out on stage with the confidence of a rock star, waving out at the crowd as the piano intro plays.</p>

<p>( MUSIC: "TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW" )</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(clears his throat)</p>
<p>Hello and welcome to opening ceremonies. It's the 17th annual, 2nd iteration, 3rd location for our dear con. And I'd like to list our... expectations.</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>Let's start our con our right for those of you stayin' up all night.
<p>The 3rd floor is the designated "noisy block".</p>
<p>Clothes must be worn at all times.</p>
<p>Please, observe all markings and signs and remember...</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(spoken)</p>
<p>Security is here for your ... safety.</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>Our charity is here, the local animal shelter.</p>
<p>We hope you'll be as generous, as you can with them.</p>
<p>Our con operations room is one-twenty-five.</p>
<p>If you have issues come on over and heeeeey!</p>
<p>Tell me somethin' I don't know!</p>
<p>Gimme something I ain't never heard before.</p>
<p>After two  decades of cons, there's not much can go wrong that hasn't happened at least fifteen times already.</p>
<p>Soooooo, tell me something' I don't know!</p>
<p>Make my jaw drop when you walk in the door.</p>
<p>there's no need to be scared, the staff and I are prepared.</p>
<p>So tell me something I don't knoooooooow!!</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(spoken)</p>
<p>So, I think it goes without saying, don't wear masks of <span class="italic">any</span> kind in the casino. They take that pretty seriously.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>HECKLER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(distant shout)</p>
<p>Why don't you guys have a theme?!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>Askin' about the con theme, son?</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(stumbles into spoken)</p>
<p>Well, we couldn't think of one, so we'll be sure to get on that for next year...
<p>We got some, last minute schedule changes.</p>
<p>Dances now run till 3am and if you wanna be in the car show, <span class="italic">yes</span>, you must own a car.</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>The fursuit parade has, once again, been canceled.</p>
<p>But hey, if you wanna take a walk, please do it anywhere except for the Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>They want your business but not as a giant cat, oooooh!</p>
<p>Tell me somethin' I don't know.</p>
<p>Gimme something I ain' never heard before.</p>
<p>After two decades of cons, there's not much can go wrong that hasn't happened at least fifteen times already soooooo,</p>
<p>Tell me something' I don't know!</p>
<p>Make my jaw drop when you walk in the door.</p>
<p>There's no need to be scared, the staff and I are prepared!</p>
<p>So, tell me something I don't knoooooooow!</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(clear throat, spoken)</p>
<p>Well, uh. That should about do it for me. Try to go see some panels. We got a band playing at some point. uh... no vaping indoors. And remember, you may only board the elevator from the ground floor. If you go down to go up, <span class="italic">I'll personally murder you</span>. Thanks!</p>
</div>

<p>( END: "TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW" )</p>

<p>Quiet, awkward chuckles ring from the crowd. Along with the subtle hyena giggles of Diego.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>But seriously guys! Don't do that.  Other than that, everybody, have a great con and go out there and <span class="italic">have fun</span>!!</p>
</div>

<p>The crowd erupts into cheers. Diego widens his eyes a bit in surprise. He shakes his head, puts on a big smile, and waves at the audience while walking off stage.</p>


<h3>BACKSTAGE</h3>

<p>He turns the microphone off and sets it on a chair near the stage entrance, and proceeds to pull out his phone.  Looking at the screen a bit his face puts on a slight angry scowl.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(growls)</p>
<p>Damn hotel Wifi...</p>
</div>

<p>Diego puts his phone back in his pocket and takes a step forward, only to violently knock his head into Rojo.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Ow!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>ROJO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(startled)</p>
<p>Wuh? Oh, Diego! How's it going? Man, I'm glad they got the power back on! What was that about?</p>
</div>

<p>Diego looks off to the side.</p>




<h2>FLASHBACK TO:</h2>

<h3>BACKSTAGE - EARLIER</h3>

<p>Diego is backstage in front of a board with switches and dials. Diego takes one of the dials and twists it to the right, causing sparks to fly and lights to dim on the panel. An A/V CREWMAN dives in to turn the dial back down, the lights going out before he can reach it.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CREWMAN</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(growling)</p>
<p>Diego!</p>
</div>

<h3>BACK TO PRESENT</h3>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(dodgy)</p>
<p>I dunno! I was checking that things were okay with A/V and it just went out!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>ROJO</h4>
<p>Oh! Right! I wanted to let you know the panel rooms are all set up and--</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p><span class="bold">Great!</span> Rojo, I gotta run! I've gotta make sure the dealers den has enough volunteers and security.</p>
</div>

<p>Diego starts walking away from Rojo out to main stage.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>ROJO</h4>
<p>But, there's plenty!</p>
</div>

<p>Rojo shakes his head in frustration, looking at a spreadsheet of events on his phone. He uses his free hand to scratch behind his flop ear, causing his eyelids to droop slightly and his footpaw to bounce.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>VOLUNTEER (O.S.)</h4>
<p>Hey, Rojo? The guy running the kink meet and greet doesn't have anyone to check IDs, he says it's our job.</p>
</div>

<p>Rojo turns towards the voice.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>ROJO</h4>
<p>No, it's not! I tell everyone when we schedule their panels. Ugh, I'll go talk to him.</p>
</div>


<p>HALLWAY</p>

<p>The doors to the main stage open as people pour out, including Thistle and Clover. Thistle holds his phone about eye-level inaudibly reading it off as Clover weaves them both through the crowd.</p>

<p>Clover's eyes focus in on something, he stops abruptly.  Thistle without missing a beat, walks right around him and continues reading off his phone.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>We're going to have to reschedule the go-karts, but it's okay. I'm just sad that we're going to miss the puppy play 101 panel. I love puppies!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(eyes still focus away)</p>
<p>That's not-- Uh, we can go to that one next year... But, hey, look up for a sec.</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle lowers his phone, looks up at Clover, then to the same direction as Clover. Thistle's eyes light up and his jaw drops.</p>

<p>A medley of colorful fur approaches, as a group of Fursuiters mob the hallway. The Fursuiters walk right in front of the crowd that the two are in. Clover grins, watching the excited little dog take in the sight.</p>

<p>( MUSIC: "STITCHES" )</p>

<p>Thistle steps through the gathering crowd, in tune with the opening piano keys of "STITCHES". The crowd blurs away into a fuzzy haze of shapes. The naturally lit corridor brightens to an almost iridescent glow. He dances unnoticed between the Fursuiters.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>I'm waking up to a whole new shade of gray.</p>
<p>I'm seeing things that might make some run away.</p>
<p>Look at the ears and the eyes, the tail that bobs behind and tell me:</p>
<p>How do you stitch it all up?</p>
<p>How do you stitch it all up?</p>
<p>I'd call it sculpture, but I might understate.</p>
<p>I'm trying hard not to overcompensate.</p>
<p>I feel the jitters as I step into the con space.</p>
<p>How can they stitch it all up? How can they stitch it all up?</p>
<p>I'm in stitches!</p>
<p>Can I take our picture please?</p>
<p>I'm in stitches!</p>
<p>Is it dramatic to fall onto my knees.</p>
<p>Oh my god! Holy crap! Baby this is where it's at!</p>
<p>I'm in stitches.</p>
<p>I am home at last.</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle continues dancing between the Fursuiters.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>Maybe a partial, or maybe a full suit.
<p>I do believe this is so much more than cute.</p>
<p>Oh wow! My favorite dog! Ya think she'll notice me?</p>
<p>How can they stitch it all up?</p>
<p>I'm glad they switch it all up.</p>
<p>I'm in stitches.</p>
<p>Seeing everything I've seen.</p>
<p>I'm in stitches.</p>
<p>It's like walking in a dream.</p>
<p>Oh my god! Holy crap! Never seen a suit like that!</p>
<p>I'm in stitches!</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(gasp)</p>
<p>I think I found my crush!</p>
<p>Look at the colors and shapes. Can you commit and escape?</p>
<p>Was this a custom or an auction?</p>
<p>I wanna know, how's the visibility?</p>
<p>Do you need a cooling vest?</p>
<p>Is there padding in the chest?</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(giggling)</p>
<p>Okay, you know what I mean but seriously.</p>
<p>I need one of my oooooooooown.</p>
<p>I'm in stitches!</p>
<p>Maybe I could try one on.</p>
<p>I'm in stitches!</p>
<p>Pop my head and I'll be gone.</p>
<p>Oh my god! Holy crap! It's my station and I've been waiting!</p>
<p>I'm in stitches! I'm in stitches!</p>
<p>I'm in stitcheeeeeeees!</p>
<p>And you can't cut me out.</p>
</div>

<p>The lighting returns to normal as Thistle returns to Clover's side.</p>

<p>( END: "STITCHES" )</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(excited)</p>
<p>This is so amazing! I thought they canceled the fursuit parade!</p>
</div>

<p>HOLLIE, a German shepherd female with bright pink hair, standing just in front of them in the crowd, turns her head while clapping.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>HOLLIE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(over her shoulder)</p>
<p>Ha! Come on, we're furries! We don't need a schedule to tell us how to have fun. Woo!</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle looks at his phone, then back at Hollie. Putting away his phone, Thistle looks up towards Clover.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Hey, you wanna check out the Dealer's Den?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Yeah. Is that in the schedule?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>It wasn't until tomorrow, but we've got thirty minutes!</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(bashfully admitting)</p>
<p>Also, I kinda wanna check out fursuit stuff now.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover chuckles. They both turn and push through the crowd.</p>


<a name="scene4"></a>
<h3>INT. RANDOM HOTEL ROOM - DAY</h3>

<p>A hotel room, similar to the Guest Room. The furniture is pushed against the walls or upturned. The bedding spread all around. Empty glass bottles of various shapes and labels spread on the floor. Through the curtains, a stream of daylight flows in.</p>

<p>On the floor, Sahny lays on their back, motionless, jaw wide open, arms spread out. The beam of light shines upon their face.</p>

<p>Three other people lay on the ground in various compromising positions next to Sahny. A tipped over bowl of chips and scattered black and white cards add to the chaos of the room.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(progressively louder)</p>
<p>Uuuhhhgggghhh wwhhherree the?!</p>
</div>

<p>The noise causes the other occupants to move and shift, but not to wake.</p>

<p>Sahny opens their eyes and looks around. The hyena sharply sits upright, patting their chest, their pockets, then, their crotch. Holding at the crotch, they let out a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Sahny gets to their feet, firmly rubbing their temple while squinting. They scratch under their arm. Removing their hand, they pull out a sweaty playing card. They look at it with surprise and disgust, then flick it aside. They grab their hoodie and pick up the cell phone charging on the nightstand before shuffling out.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>FEMALE BEAR(O.S.)</h4>
<p>Drink some water before you leave. It is important to keep hydrated.</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny turns to meet a polar bear who is already holding a full glass of water to offer them, with slight hesitation they accept the offering. After nearly drowning themselves the hyena manages to set the glass down, thanks the bear and slips out of the room all in one motion. Shutting the door and noting "512" as the room number. The thought crosses over them of returning as a backup in the event that other parties fall through.</p>

<p>While making their way through the hallways and down to the con space Sahny checks for new messages in the main group chat.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ (TEXT)</h4>
<p>@XxSAHNYNo1xX where'd you go? Everyone's in for the night and I snagged a key for you.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">

</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE (TEXT)</h4>
<p>Sahny's not answering my calls, staff said their badge was picked up though. If we don't hear back from them by about noon I'd say we could start breaking down doors and tracking them down.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE (TEXT)</h4>
<p>It's Clover btw, my phone can't seem to get signal inside the building.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ (TEXT)</h4>
<p>I don't know of anyone who'd answer a call at 6:30am, that's too early even for me to be fully functioning. Keep me posted though! I'm setting up what I need in the DD.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY (TEXT)</h4>
<p>I'm alive. Stop stressing fam. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

</div>

<div class="dialogue">

<div class="dialogue">

<p>Are any of these going through?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER (TEXT)</h4>
<p>To see several people perform*</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER (TEXT)</h4>
<p>Phone seems to have caught a solid signal, I'll activate my location.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover shared his location.</p>



<a name="scene5"></a>
<h3>INT. DEALER'S DEN - DAY</h3>

<p>The room is filled with rows of tables, side by side, lined with various hand-crafted swag and art pieces. Crowds walk along one side of the tables. On the other side, merchants stand to pitch their products or sit behind frames crowded with items, quietly sketching.</p>

<p>Thistle and Clover enter into the Dealer's Den. Thistle looks in awe at the micro-market before him.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Wow! There's so much stuff here!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Yup, all kinds of things here. There's some fursuit makers, few book, artists like Baz, there's even a nice dragon lady that makes soap.</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle and Clover browse some of the tables of wares. Behind one of the tables, sits YOTE ARMOUR, a green-eyed coyote with hair like fire. He leans in toward PIPER FOX, a red fox with soot-black hair wearing naught but a pair of shorts. Armour points out Thistle's "Good Boix" shirt.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>ARMOUR</h4>
<p>Get a load of this kid in the green shirt. What is that bright nonsense?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>PIPER</h4>
<p>Oh, I dunno. It looks fine to me. I think I've seen that design somewhere before.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>ARMOUR</h4>
<p>Well, was there an option for girls too? I mean, all dogs is good dogs.</p>
</div>

<p>Piper shrugs a shoulder and makes a gesture that reads something to effect of "When you're right, you're right."</p>

<p>Thistle and Clover peruse the dealers. Clover walks with a slow pace behind the spastic canine jumping between items at the tables.</p>

<p>Thistle stops at a table with a "HushPuppies" sign in provocative coloring, suggestive fonts and covered in a various leather accessories over a sensual table linen. Curiously, Thistle picks up the a collar of soft chocolate leather with blaze orange stitching.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(perplexed)</p>
<p>Is this to wear?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Yup. I mean, it's not everyone's cup of tea, but some people do like it.</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle loosely strings the collar to his neck, examining the look in a mirror. Clover smiles faintly.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY (O.S.)</h4>
<p>There you are!</p>
</div>

<p>Clover jolts forward. Sahny stands behind him, clutching his arms at the elbows. Clover sharply spins around, teeth bared. Only easing a bit when he recognizes Sahny.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(growling)</p>
<p>Don't. do. that.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>I've been running all over the hotel looking for you! Your phone location is pinging all over the place. What gives?</p>
</div>

<p>Clover's stance returns to normal, as he pulls his phone from his pocket.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Ah, my phone can't get any kind of signal here.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(point at Clover's phone)</p>
<p>No wonder, that thing's older than me!</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny's eyes focus past Clover at the table behind him.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(motions to the table)</p>
<p>Wow, you two are moving pretty fast!</p>
</div>

<p>Clover looks back at the table, then dips a bashful head. Thistle turns to Sahny, setting the collar down. Sahny gives a quick upward tip of the head to Thistle.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Oh, hi Sahny!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">

<p class="parenthetical">(deflated)</p>
<p>Uh, no.</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny turns to leave in defeat, but hesitates and turns back with a smile. Reaching past them, Sahny pulls out a collar and hands it to Thistle.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(to Clover)</p>
<p><span class="italic">here</span> this is the one.</p>

<p>Thistle thoughtfully wraps his fingers around the collar. Clover shakes his head as Sahny leaves.</p>

<p>Alrighty, let's move shall we?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>

<p>Clover walks off. Thistle places the collar back on the table and rejoins him.</p>

<p>Clover stops at the end of the row in front of Baz's table. He looks around for a bit.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Huh. This is Baz's table. Where the heck is she?</p>

<p>Clover scans for the sergal.</p>

<h3>DEALER'S DEN - EARLIER</h3>

<p>Baz hurries along the crowd with a chain-brand coffee cup in hand as her messenger bag sways in her hustle. She looks up and stops abruptly.</p>

<p>At the end of a row of vendors is a table divided by two banners. The first banner is decorated in colorful cartoon animals, next the text "Bazeri" along with various social media icons including SocialCreature's. Behind the other banner that reads "dauB - Fine art illustration" sits an extremely tall, pale-orange tiger, dressed in Boho chic. DAUB takes his big, round glasses to wipe them off with his shirt and smiles warmly at the passersby.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(takes a deep breath)</p>
<p>No, it'll be alright.</p>
</div>

<p>The lights fade on the dealers den, the piano tune fades in, a spotlight shines on Baz. Her purple jacket shimmers like a sequin dress. She walks towards the table, singing and dancing as she goes.</p>

<p>( MUSIC: "BUY MY STUFF" )</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>

<p>Baz walks around to the back of table with dauB. He looks up at her with a warm smile.</p>

<p>Baz stands grabbing her sketchbook. The table disappears as she stands.</p>





<h2>MATCH CUT TO:</h2>

<h3>INT. F.U.R.S. BAR - NIGHT</h3>

<p>Baz sits down as a small pub table slides into place in front of her. Baz sets down her sketchbook and rests on her arm as she leans towards dauB. She listens intently to his continued story, as he gestures with his hands.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>

<a name="scene7"></a>
<h3>INT. SECOND STAGE - NIGHT</h3>

<p>Gathered around a well-lit stage are several groups of suiters and attendees, hundreds of eyes glued in anticipation of the competition as it unfolds. A fox suiter finishes his set, and standing before them now is the champion from the previous years. SLEDGE is an Ocelot of varying shades of pink with onyx markings, his eyes in and out of suit are a unique shade of ice blue. The crowd goes absolutely wild once he looks around, shouting and cheering as the announcer attempts to talk over them. One of the louder voices belongs to a GAZELLE who seems to be getting into a stance to run forward onto the stage when Sledge lifts both hands and shakes his head in panic. A gasp erupts from several of the members in the crowd as the bovidae is frozen in place like a deer in headlights.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>GAZELLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(nearly fainting)</p>
<p>Oh my god. He looked at me! He noticed me!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>ANNOUNCER  (OVER SPEAKERS)</h4>
<p>For our next performer, give it up for Sledge the dancing ocelot!</p>
</div>

<p>A catchy melody plays, accompanied by defined bass kicks as Sledge makes his way across the waxed floor and begins to resemble liquid in the smoothness of his contortions. Behind Sahny's plush suit head are dagger wielding eyes, scanning for a mishap and as Sledge oversteps during part of his routine, Sahny is satisfied in watching him recover.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>ANNOUNCER  (OVER SPEAKERS)</h4>
<p>An excellent display from Sledge! He could take home first prize again this year!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(muffled, singsongy)</p>
<p>Not after they see me shine he won't.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>ANNOUNCER (OVER SPEAKERS)</h4>
<p>Next up is the very controversial, you may love them you may hate them, Sahhhhhhhnnnnnyyyyyyyyy!</p>
</div>

<p>Slow and soft the song begins, a perfectly paced opening as the freestyler makes their way to the optimal place in ample time. Divulging into several breakbeat style switches, the tune invites the very pop-n-lock moves Sahny shows off. Some have been seen with last years performance but a lot have not, and there still seems to be a card unplayed on the field. With the glances in between angled adjustments Sahny spots Clover and Thistle one moment, and the next they are gone. A glimpse of blue and pale white. Could it be? Hard to tell with the sudden crowd gathered on the right side of the stage.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(muffled)</p>
<p>I've never had this big a turnout before! I wonder how many will line up to get my autograph?! Okay, you've got this! We've practiced it hundreds of times before. We couldn't be more ready.</p>
</div>

<p>The beat seems to climb higher and higher in pitch before dropping and in that moment of time Sahny manages to perfectly land a backflip. The crowd roars, but among the various voices a distinct noise, a series of energetic chirps and excited whistles can be heard.</p>



<h3>SECOND STAGE - EARLIER</h3>

<p>Diego paces behind the judges table, toying with his radio from paw to paw. He nervously watches the crowd, visually checking the lighting and listening acutely to the audio quality. He waits for an opportunity to talk to the judge who is watching the competitors intently.
<br>


<div class="dialogue">
<h4>ANNOUNCER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(OVER SPEAKERS)</p>
<p>Excellent performance by Sledge. Next up, we have a veteran of the stage, the controversial Sahnyyyyy!</p>
</div>

<p>As Sahny begins their routine, Diego taps the main judge on the shoulder. The judge looks startled as they break their attention from the dancer on the floor. Looking slightly upset until they see who is interrupting them.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>JUDGE</h4>
<p>What the-- Oh! Hey Diego! Everything OK?</p>
</div>

<p>The judge turns around and gives the hyena their complete attention. The pair speak quietly due to the competition going on around them.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Yeah, yeah. I was just listening to the last few tracks. Do you hear that slight audio distortion?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>JUDGE</h4>
<p>Um, nah! We already went through all the tracks before hand.</p>
</div>

<p>The judge distractedly looks back to Sahny's dancing then back at Diego.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>I swear I hear it. I've got an ear for this stuff. I could look at the settings for you.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>JUDGE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(distracted)</p>
<p>I think we're good Diego, besides I gotta judge this guy.</p>
</div>

<p>Diego looks up at Sahny's routine and huffs.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Damn, I was hoping to catch Finn's routine, but I had to refill the water coolers in the fursuit lounge.</p>
</div>

<p>The judge nervously turns back to Sahny's routine a little distracted</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Did they go on yet? They're obviously going to win.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>JUDGE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(sighs)</p>
<p>No, not yet. They are one hell of a show stopper aren't they?</p>
</div>

<p>The judge smiles.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Yeah. Finn kinda reminds me of myself. Real stage presence yanno?</p>
</div>

<p>The judge becomes a little more visibly agitated and distracted by the routine he's supposed to be watching</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>JUDGE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(thinking)</p>
<p>Yeah. They definitely do.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>I bet the crowd will lose it <span class="italic">when</span> Finn wins.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>JUDGE</h4>
<p>I don't know, there's a lot of talent out there this year. Like this guy, he really gives it his all.</p>
</div>

<p>The Judge nods to the stage. Diego snorts.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Yeah, no. He has like no tail control, and I mean a purple deer? Really?</p>
</div>

<p>Diego rolls his eyes</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Think I could give the trophy to Finn?</p>
</div>

<p>Diego sports a toothy grin at the thought of that happening. The judge winces at what Diego just suggested, but only briefly. Sahny's song is wrapping up and the judge immediately looks shocked and whips around to face the dance floor.</p>

<p>Diego not wanting to interrupt the show, slinks off.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>ANNOUNCER (OVER SPEAKERS)</h4>
<p>Another provocative display by the dancing violet deer, Sahny! Our next perform--</p>
</div>



<a name="scene8"></a>
<h3>INT. MAIN FURSUIT LOUNGE - NIGHT</h3>

<p>Sahny is drowning themselves in body spray, febreezing the parts of their suit that is dry and desperately attempting to dust and fan out the moisture that has found its way into the most troublesome of places. Switching the usual amber eyes with an intoxicating neon spiral of green was all part of the transformation as the evening fast approached.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CONGOER #1 (O.S.)</h4>
<p>Oh my god it's Keystone!!! Keyyyyystoneeeeeee!</p>
</div>

<p>Dropping everything and throwing the still damp head over their balaclava, the hyena wastes no time launching themselves back onto the dance floor. The opportunity to see their idol face to face is too good to pass up.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(muffled)</p>
<p>Coming through! Make way for the dance competition champion! I must see my idol!</p>
</div>

<p>Within moments Sahny met the wall of people gathered around Keystone, a blue and white Dutch Angel Dragon suiter who speaks only in chirps, clicks and whistles while in character. This was the very moment Sahny planned, waited, and aimed for; if only they could get through to them they could secure the connection. Yet still, the harder Sahny fought to squeeze in between people the farther back they were tossed when the crowd ejected them. Falling hard on their back the wind was ripped from the hyena's lungs and for a moment it almost sank in how truly small and insignificant they were.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(extremely muffled)</p>
<p>I can't breathe! I need help up! Please!</p>
</div>

<p>Sledge tripping and managing to save the fall with a tumble.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SLEDGE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(extremely muffled)</p>
<p>Why are you laying in the middle of the walkway?!</p>
</div>

<p>Sledge grunts as he helps Sahny to their feet.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SLEDGE</h4>
<p>Oh no! Get up! Get up! We gotta move! Talk to me, tell me you're still conscious.</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny struggles to walk as they lean on Sledge.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>I'm here, but my pride's fled the scene.</p>
</div>

<p>Sledge spends a few moments in the headless lounge feeding cold air and water to Sahny.</p>

<p>Once Sahny catches their breath, Sledge helps them get back in suit.</p>

<p>As Sahny emerges once more from the headless lounge their eyes fall on Keystone's entourage following with envy.</p>

<a name="scene8-2"></a>
<p>( MUSIC: "POWER" )</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>I don't know their faces, never learned their names.</p>
<p>Realized there's a difference between being in the crowd and being cheered onto the stage</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>I've been climbing ever higher.</p>
<p>See my name on every list</p>

<div class="dialogue">

<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>On my own I might be feeble hardly worth a second glance</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>

<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>

<p>Gimme all the Power</p>
</div>

<p>( END: "POWER" )</p>

<p>Sahny sighs and heads back to the hotel room to change into a different suit, needing to save the deer for Saturday night. As they approach the room a note on the door catches their eyes, and it reads:</p>

<p>"You were fire out there! Looking forward to seeing you win, fam." -- Keystone~</p>

<p>Sahny's hands shake in excitement and shock, quickly looking around to see if anyone else is in the hallway. The idea that their idol stalked them back to their room is quickly shot down by the familiar drawing left on the door that Baz did for the four of them. Entering the room to change, the door shuts behind the hyena with a soft click.</p>


<a name="scene9"></a>
<h3>INT. CON SPACE - NIGHT</h3>

<h3>HALLWAY OUTSIDE PANELS</h3>

<p>In a short corridor with gaudy carpet and a handful of open doors with temporary signage for Fursasion panel details, Thistle and Clover rush out of one of the doorways. Clover jams his palms into his eyes, stretching his eyelids. Thistle is stiff shoulder and wide-eyed.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>That is <span class="italic">not</span> the panel I thought it was.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Yeah, let's not go to the second part of that one.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(quiet)</p>
<p>That was soooo weird.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Agreed. Maybe we should grab some cotton candy?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Ooh! Yeah!</p>
</div>

<p>Clover pops the top on his water bottle and peers into the opening.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>I need more water. Can you grab the cotton candy while I fill up our bottles? The guy by Con-Ops is giving out cotton candy.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover pulls money from his wallet.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Here, add this to the tip jar.</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle exchanges his bottle for the cash and walks away.</p>

<p>Clover fills up a bottle from a water cooler in the hallway. Music thumps through the walls. As the bottle continues to fill, Clover pulls out his phone and flicks at it with his thumb. A muffled thud. He looks to the right.</p>


<h3>OUTSIDE CON-OPS</h3>

<p>A machine whines as it converts granules of sugar into the consistency of a carded cotton.</p>

<p>A spectacularly dressed individual dips a paper cone into the machine and presents the second pink cloud of goodness to the ever so excited, bouncing white pooch. Thistle swipes up the treat, tosses the cash into the tip vessel, then walks away as another steps in to fill his space in line.</p>


<h3>HALLWAY OUTSIDE PANELS</h3>

<p>Thistle bites a chunk out of the cloud of sugar as he rounds the corner where he last left Clover. He halts and whips his head away from the cotton candy, small strands cling to his doggo lips.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>What'd you do?!</p>
</div>

<p>Clover kneels next to LINNUX, a passed out mouse in a teal penguin fursuit with a red trilby and bowtie. Her suit head is off and resting to the side. Her mousy fur is wet and matted. Clover, in a panic, fans her with his phone.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>I didn't <span class="italic">do</span> this! Look, go get help.</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle stands, clutching the two cotton candies. His face affixed on the fainted fursuiter. Clover continues fanning her. She mumbles incoherently. Clover looks back at the dog, who is frozen in fright.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(stern)</p>
<p>Thistle!</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle's head moves as if to look at Clover but instead looks through him.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Go get a staff member!</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle's eyes focus on Clover.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Go back to Con-Ops!</p>
</div>

<p>Clover punches through the air, pointing toward the hallway. Thistle scrambles in that general direction, disappearing behind the corner.</p>

<p>Clover continues fanning the suiter. He stops to check his phone. He grunts and shakes the phone violently.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Dammit, come on!</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle runs back around the corner, holding a cotton candy in each paw. He's followed by KRUS, a tall red panda with a patch on his vest labeled "Service Dog", who is carrying a first aid kit.</p>

<p>Krus kneels next to Linnux. Opening the first aid kit, he pulls out an ice pack and puts it on her head as she starts to stir.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>KRUS</h4>
<p>Could you tell me what happened?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>I'm guessing she was dancing next door and got too hot. I was filling up our water bottles when I heard her go down.</p>
</div>

<p>Krus kneels down next to her. He opens the first aid kit, then repositions her feet.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>KRUS</h4>
<p>Okay, you did good. I'll take it from here.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover wobbles to his feet. Holding a bear claw to his fuzzy forehead, he lets out a deep wavering sigh. Thistle, still clinging to the cotton candy, stares at Linnux and Krus. Clover lowers his paw and glances at Thistle.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Ho, man. Okay. Umm, are you ready to move on?</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle nods, not changing his gaze.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>You gonna be okay?</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle looks up at Clover with those puppy dog eyes.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Listen, are you okay if we head back to the room? I'm beat.</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle lowers his hand as if to reach for his pocket, stopping once he recalls the cotton candy in hand.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(quiet)</p>
<p>I think that'll be okay, ya.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Come on then, elevators are this way.</p>
</div>

<p>They start walking. Thistle mindlessly licks the cotton candy, dissolving it slowly. He looks at it and motions the spare over to Clover. Clover refuses it with a hand wave.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Why did you get so much? We'll never be able to eat that.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(quiet)</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I could.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>You probably don't need the sugar.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>I feel like I do right now.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Pretty shaken up? Me too.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>I've never seen someone like that before. All helpless.</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle's last word echoes softly. Clover's eyes dart ponderously.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(short, quiet)</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</div>

<p>They arrive at the elevators. In the small elevator corridor, a crowd has formed so large they have had to exceed the weight limit of multiple elevators.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Ah, crap! Cuss this. Let's go.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover pushes past the crowd, making a gap that slowly closes behind him. Poor Thistle struggles to keep up, weaving politely through the oblivious crowd.</p>




<h3>INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT</h3>

<p>Clover forces open the steel door of the stairwell, it slams against the wall.  He starts up the stairs. The door begins to close. He sighs and snatches the door, holding it open just as Thistle walks through.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(timid)</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(under his breath)</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover lets the door close. Thistle stops. Clover makes it halfway up the flight before...</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(hesitant)</p>
<p>Clover?</p>
</div>

<p>Clover stops.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Did I mess up?</p>
</div>

<p>Clover whips around.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(concerned)</p>
<p>Wha? No! I'm just--</p>

<p class="parenthetical">(pleading)</p>
<p>Ugh! Look, can we just get to the room, okay?</p>
</div>

<p>Clover climbs a few steps.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(voice cracking)</p>
<p>Clover, are you okay?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>I just need to think! Come on, kid!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Kid?</p>
</div>

<p>Looking up toward Clover, Thistle's eyes glimmer in the cruddy stairwell lighting. Clover's face softens, the anger melts into remorse.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Oh! I didn't--</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle's chin trembles, he drops his head. HAWKUS, a lanky bird dog, pushes open the door carrying a cardboard box with some weight to it. He stops and looks between the two of them. Clover turns his head away.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>HAWKUS</h4>
<p>Oop, sorry.</p>
</div>

<p>Hawkus walks up the stairs, followed closely by Thistle. He scooches past the bear.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>HAWKUS</h4>
<p>P... pardon me.</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle makes his way past as well, with his face hidden. Clover watches him pass, reaching out as they become adjacent, but Thistle retracts from the bear's reach. Clover pulls his arm away.</p>

<p>Hawkus and Thistle disappear up the flights. Their footsteps fade away. Clover watches them go, then pauses for a brief minute. He growls and smacks his forehead twice. Second time, holding his head. He finally sighs an exasperated sigh.</p>




<h3>INT. THE GUEST ROOM - NIGHT</h3>

<p>Thistle lays in bed with his face buried in a pillow. The cotton candies lay on their sides on the end table. The door creaks open. A defeated Clover walks into the middle of the room, sighing as he sees Thistle. He leans against the wall next to his bag and slides down to sit on the ground. He covers his face with his hands, his elbows resting on his knees. Breathes in. Rubs his face. Exhales slowly.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(quiet)</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that.</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle repositions his head, cheek to the pillow. Both of his arms still wrapped around the pillow.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>I'm not a kid.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>I know.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>I'm an adult.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>I know.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>With a job ... which I hate.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>I am really sorry. I didn't mean to snap at you.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>I know. Is it because I froze?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>What? Oh. No.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover rubs his handpaws together.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>No, it's something I need to deal with, alright? Sorry I put a damper on the evening. We'll hang out more tomorrow, though. I can take you to the store, pick you up some clothes.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>That'll be nice.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover closes his eyes.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Hey, Clover? I don't want you to see me as a kid.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Don't worry, bud. I don't.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Good night, Clover.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Good night. Thanks again for dinner.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(quiet)</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover stares for a beat, sighs, then lays down.</p>



<a name="scene10"></a>
<h3>INT. OUTSIDE F.U.R.S. THEATER - NIGHT</h3>

<p>Baz and dauB exit the theater. Daub holds a huge bucket of popcorn. Baz walks beside him, clasping her muzzle.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>Ahh, always a classic!</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(scoff)</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(muffled)</p>
<p>I. Am. So. Sorry.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>Hehe, about what?</p>
</div>

<p>Baz stares at the floor.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(muffled)</p>
<p>I know I talked the whole time. I can't help it.</p>
</div>

<p>Daub smiles, tugging her arms away from her mouth. She takes them back and covers her eyes, looking between her fingers at dauB.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>It's fine! I don't mind, I enjoyed the commentary.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>I don't think the people behind us liked it.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(laughing)</p>
<p>Well, they didn't say anything. To be honest, I thought it was great. Reminded me of that one show with the two robots and the dude in space.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(mumbling)</p>
<p>I love that dumb show. I watched the original as a kid. Think it ruined me.</p>
</div>

<p>Baz resumes walking down the hall with dauB. He munches on handfuls of popcorn. She hesitates then turns to dauB, stopping.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Despite having way too much candy in there. I could really go for fro-joe!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>A what now?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Fro-joe. It's like a rootbeer float, but with coffee and frozen yogurt.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>That sounds awful!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>You just don't know what's good.</p>
</div>

<p>Baz and dauB laugh as they continue on.</p>




<h3>INT. CHAIN-BRAND COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT</h3>

<p>Baz and dauB sit in a hole-in-the-wall coffee shop. She holds a white paper mug. He has a mostly eaten, unwrapped candy bar placed squarely in front of him. Baz spoons a bit of frozen yogurt that drips with specialty coffee. She sways the spoon as she talks and takes a bite mid sentence.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(holding back laughter)</p>
<p>Ever since then, I've never been able to look at eggnog the same way again.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(laughing)</p>
<p>Ah, that is so gnarly!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(laughing)</p>
<p>My pop still teases me about it.</p>
</div>

<p>The laughter subsides. She wipes a tear from the corner of her eye. Daub eats the last bit of candy bar. The two sit in silence for a moment. She picks up the cup, looks into it, swirls it, then offers it to dauB. He waves his hands and shakes his head. She frowns.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>You didn't like it, did you?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>No! It was actually good! I take back what I said earlier. I just, I'm stuffed.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(smirking)</p>
<p>Mm-hmm!</p>
</div>

<p>Baz watches in curiosity as Daub takes the candy wrapper and thoughtfully folds it.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>That's curious.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>This? Yeah. I take moments out of my day to be more mindful.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>That's cool. So, you do stuff like yoga?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>I meditate. You do any?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>No, I always felt silly. Just sittin' around.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>Me too, at first.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>I have always wanted to though. It seems fascinating.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>For me, I needed too.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Why?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(hesitant)</p>
<p>Well, I can get very grumpy if I don't.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>What? No! You seem so calm too.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(chuckling)</p>
<p>Then it works!</p>
</div>

<p>Baz looks at her phone and groans</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>It's getting late. I need to head back to the room to work on these commissions.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>Yikes! Yup, me too.</p>
</div>

<p>They both stand. DauB snags up all the trash. Baz shoulders her messenger bag. As they walk next to each other, dauB tosses the rubbish in the recycle, then dusts his paws. Baz watches him, smirking.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Oy, I should do that, but think what's the point? I've probably killed a whole forest with all the sketchbooks I go through.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(frowns)</p>
<p>Aww, but think of the baby squirrel!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Ohhh, now you're making me feel bad!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>I'm only teasin' ya. When it's for art, it's different. It's special. And that's gotta be worth something, ya know?</p>
</div>

<p>Baz is smiling, a sort of bitter sweet smile.</p>

<p>They stop in front of the elevators, Daub presses the elevator call button.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>This is where I'll leave ya for the night.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Oh, you're not staying at the hotel?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>Nah, I'm staying in with a buddy in the RV park. It's a bit cheaper.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Ugh, how can you be in that tiny space with someone for a weekend? Sahny and I would be at each other's throats and Clover would do us both in.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>Your friends sound like characters. I hope to meet them tomorrow.</p>
</div>

<p>The elevator bings. The doors slide open, some fursuiters step off and some more step into the elevator.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Okay. I gotta run. It was very fun hanging out with you.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>I'll catch ya tomorrow. Sleep well!</p>
</div>

<p>Baz steps into the elevator and begins to yawn. She covers her mouth and waves excitedly with her other hand. She manages to finish her yawn, before the doors starts closing.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>You too! See--</p>
</div>

<p>The elevator door shuts.</p>



<a name="scene11"></a>
<h3>INT. THE GUEST ROOM - NIGHT</h3>

<p>The Guest Room lays restless at night. Clover is curled in a wool blanket on the floor. Thistle snores somewhere in a mess of sheets. The latch whirs and the door slides open. Baz walks into the room. Her messenger bag slides off her shoulder, dragging on the floor behind her.</p>

<p>Baz steps past the bear and sits at the table in the corner of the room. She clicks on the lamp. Pulls out her sketchbook, sets it on the table and presses her pencil to the page.</p>

<h2>DISSOLVE TO:</h2>

<p>Baz lays with her face down in her sketchbook. A sharp hyena giggle rings out. Baz jumps in her seat and rubs her weary head. Sahny can be heard behind the door, giggling like an idiot  after managing to place the keycard in properly. Sahny steps into the room, confused at Baz still being awake so late in the evening. Baz looks up in concern.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(groggy, shocked)</p>
<p>Where were <span class="italic">you</span> tonight? Consider me impressed that you made it back! Couldn't find a room party?</p>
</div>

<p>Placing her supplies to the side, the sergal gets up from her seat, stretching to get some blood flowing after being in the same spot for so long. As Sahny removes their head and shuffles through the room, a familiar smile is plastered on their face.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Wait... I don't smell alcohol on your breath, and your eyes aren't dilated. What... <span class="italic">were</span> you up to tonight?!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Just a little bit of dancing with my favorite suiter! Partied with Keystone for awhile.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>The fursuiter that just squeaks? Wow, that's like your idol. Doesn't really seem like the party type, though.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Sadly they're not the drinking type.</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny shrugs off the suit. Baz nods appreciatively, returning to drawing.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Good, then you can take care of yourself for once.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Guys! I'm trying to sleep.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover sighs and sits up, glaring at Sahny.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>What's that? You're here at a reasonable hour and you're sober? Who the hell are you and what did you do with our Sahny?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(sticking their tongue out)</p>
<p>Go back to bed, coffin-dodger. I wanted to be respectful, isn't that what you're always preaching? Besides, celebration will start once they announce that <span class="italic">I've</span> won the dance comp!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>You're sure you've got it this time?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(deflated)</p>
<p>I mean when you put it like that, what <span class="italic">if</span> I lose? Man, that'd be a total bummer, Keystone won't want to hang out with a loser.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>You're putting a lot on that contest. That's all it is Sahny! And your life won't suddenly come crashing down if you come second place, again. You'll always be Bulbasaur to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Did you just compliment me? By insulting me? And referencing a show from the 90s?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>He means you're number one, even though you suck.</p>
</div>

<p>Baz leans over with a cheesy grin. Sahny places their paws on their hips with an exaggerated frown.</p>

<h2>FADE OUT.</h2>
