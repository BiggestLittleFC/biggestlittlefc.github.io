<p>FADE IN:</p>



<h3>INT. THE GUEST ROOM - DAY</h3>

<p>Baz is asleep at the table in the corner. Her face pressed against her sketchbook and legs crossed under her. The pencil resting in her palm rolls out of her loose grasp and clatters against the table. She jerks awake and lifts her groggy head, the fur on her cheek is disheveled. She stretches with a light groan.</p>

<p>Clover stirs beneath the woolen blanket on the floor. He flips the top of the blanket off of his face. Baz leans over and meets his sleepy eyes with a smile.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(quiet, raspy)</p>
<p>Well hello! Did you get cold last night?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(groggy)</p>
<p>Mm-mmm. I sleep too long when it's cold. Someone left the AC running.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Yeah, sorry that was me. I like the cold when I work. Must have passed out doing commissions.</p>
</div>

<p>The mound of blankets on Baz's bed lurch forward. And like rising from the dead, Sahny sits up. Wavering, they look about the room through squinted eyes.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Good morning, little one.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(raspy)</p>
<p>Which room am I in?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Well, now <span class="italic">there</span> in lays the funny part. You made it back to <span class="italic">our</span> room!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Wot?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Heh, yeah. Ain't that fun and new?</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny throws a hand toward Baz and flops back in bed with a grunt. Clover sits up, rubbing his back against the wall.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(to Baz)</p>
<p>You were out late last night.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(giggling)</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Did you get lots of work done?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(quiet)</p>
<p>No.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Well, did you have fun at least?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(rubbing her face)</p>
<p>Oh goodness, yes. I was hanging out with dauB.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>That's your art crush?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>He's not a crush! ...But, yes. He's so smart. And funny. And talented.</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(under her breath)</p>
<p>And available.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover chuckles and yawns. The alarm on Thistle's phone sounds. Baz stands up quickly and rushes across the room.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Nope, I call it first!</p>
</div>

<p>Baz shuts herself in the bathroom. Thistle shuffles out of bed and shuts off the alarm. Sahny groans and presses a pillow against their head. Thistle stretches while sitting at the edge of the bed and waves at Clover.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Morning!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Good morning.</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny shifts in bed.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>How'd you sleep?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>I slept very well, thank you!</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny shifts in the other direction. Baz comes out of the bathroom and smiles toward Thistle.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>G'morning.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Good morn--</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny wakes up with an obnoxious groan.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Ugh!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Back at ya, ya jerk.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Fight me, dingus!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>You want a piece of this?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>No, I'm lactose intolerant!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Why don't you go eat some babies, 'yeen?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Okay! That's enough, you two.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(cowing)</p>
<p>Are you two mad at each other?</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny cackles.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Oh no! We're just teasing each other. Where I'm from, it's what you do around friends.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Yeah, I grew up 'yeen. So it's how I show affection.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Oh, I guess I can see that. My older brothers liked to play rough.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>You have brothers?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Yeah, seven of them.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Whoa! Did your mom not have television?</p>
</div>

<p>Baz gives Sahny's arm a playful slap. Thistle shys away, pinching his flop ear.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Nah, I'm just kiddin' ya. I have two brothers and a sister. I'm the middle one!</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle looks baffled at the four raised fingers on Sahny's hand.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Shoot! I've got to get to the dealer's den.</p>
</div>

<p>Baz goes to the table to collect her things. Sahny lays to the side and picks up their phone from the night stand. Clover gets to his feet.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(to Thistle)</p>
<p>So, what's the first thing on your schedule today?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Ooh, let me see!</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle scrolls through his phone. His excitement fades.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Hmm, I had dealer's den scheduled after breakfast. But, we did that yesterday. Now I don't know what to do! My schedule is all off.</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle whines as he rubs his eyes in agitation.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Well, we have time! Have you taken a shower yet?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Heh, yeah Thistle! You don't want to be a musky husky!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>My aunt is a husky.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(deflated)</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>When was the last time <span class="italic">you</span> showered?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Gah, get off my back! I did it yesterday. The showers suck here, the water pressure is too low.</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle creeps out of bed with his shoulders low and his pants off. Clover averts his eyes, scanning the walls as if to look beyond them.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Yeah, I can see it. Probably has small pipes.</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny covers their mouth at an accidental hyena giggle. Clover's shocked look turns into a squinty glare. Thistle shuffles into the bathroom and shuts the door behind him.</p>

<h2>DISSOLVE TO:</h2>

<p>Clover lays on the bed, clothes by his side. Sahny is gone. The bathroom door opens and Thistle steps out. Clover sits upright. Thistle walks across the room to his bag. Clover walks into the bathroom, he looks around and peeks his head out.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Hey bud, did you use all the towels?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>I only used four of them. One to get most of the water. Another to get me aired out. Third to fluff. and the fourth is to get my feet <span class="italic">absolutely dry</span>.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(quiet)</p>
<p>Oh, I see. Alright then. I'll try again after breakfast.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover presses his tongue into his cheek.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Let's get dressed and go out for breakfast.</p>
</div>



<h3>INT. DEALER'S DEN - DAY</h3>

<p>Baz doodles at her table in the busy dealer's den. JOUDI, an individual approaches the table, but this doesn't slow Baz's drawing. They scan through the badges hanging from the commission board. They pick out one.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>JOUDI</h4>
<p>Um, excuse me. I think this is mine but I don't have glasses.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Huh? Let me see.</p>
</div>

<p>Baz looks at the badge, then at the board of badges. They all have some hint of resemblance to dauB. Baz looks over at dauB's empty chair. Then turns back to Joudi.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>I am so sorry. I'll just redo that one for you! You can come back tomorrow, I'll have that ready for you then. Is that okay?</p>
</div>

<p>Joudi nods and walks off. Baz claps a palm to her brow, looking all the badges.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(groaning)</p>
<p>Ah heck.</p>
</div>

<p>Baz groans and slams her head on the table, which makes the badges on the display sway on their hangers.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER (O.S.)</h4>
<p>That doesn't sound good. You alright?</p>
</div>

<p>Baz looks up, rubbing her brow where it collided with the ledge of the table. Clover and Thistle step up to her table.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Yeah, I'm okay. It turns out all the commissions I did last night were done wrong. I must have been too tired.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover picks up one of the badges. Thistle peeks over Clover's arm.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>They look fine to me.</p>
</div>

<p>DauB scoots past Baz and takes a seat next to her.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>Hey, everyone. Baz.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover looks at the badges then at dauB, back to the badge. Clover sets the badge back in place. And reaches toward dauB for a handshake.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>You must be Baz's table mate. I'm Clover.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>Hey! Pleasure to meet you! You must be good friends, she mentioned you a few times.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Yup, we known each other for a few years now?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(pointing between Baz and Clover)</p>
<p>Oh, are you two...?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(laughing)</p>
<p>No! No. No. I'm a...</p>
</div>

<p>Clover looks down at Thistle, who's flipping through dauB's art book.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>No, not Baz. We're just long time friends.</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(a pause)</p>
<p>Why do you ask?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(hesitant)</p>
<p>Um, no reason. It's just really good meeting you both.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover smiles at Baz. He turns the badge display away from dauB and starts pulling all the badges off. Daub turns his attention to Thistle, who is still flipping through the art book quietly. Clover pulls out his wallet.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
</div>

<p>Clover scoots the badges towards her.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>I'm gonna buy all these.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(stern)</p>
<p>No. You're not going to fix my mistake. Let me deal with this.</p>
</div>

<p>Baz slides the pile of badges away from Clover. He raises his hand to signify he backs down. Thistle turns his attention to Baz.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(bashful)</p>
<p>Um. I actually really like the rabbit one. If you're selling them still.</p>
</div>

<p>Baz's graveness melts away. She smiles compassionately at Thistle. She digs through the badges and hands him a badge of an adorable rabbit with big round rim glasses.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Tsk, aww. Here you go. On the house.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(bashful)</p>
<p>Um, if it's all the same, I'd like to buy it please. You've already done a lot for me. And this one is really cute.</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle hands her a bank card. Clover looks through the crowd and waves at someone. He starts walking in the direction, then turns back to Thistle.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>I'll be right back. I see an old friend and wanna go say hi.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(quiet)</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
</div>

<p>Baz slides his card and hands it back to Thistle. She eyes him as he takes the card without making eye contact.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>You alright, Thistle?</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle looks down, then the direction Clover went. He sighs.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Can I ask you something?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Yeah! Sure.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Clover's been different today. Do you think he hates me?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(shocked and amused)</p>
<p>Hate you?! No. Clover? That's unlikely. What makes you say that?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Ever since I left home, my schedule has been falling apart. I've planned everything and it was gonna be perfect! But, everything's falling apart. Now the whole weekend is ruined. and, and, and.</p>
</div>

<p>His last words turn into blubbering as his eyes start welling with tears.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Come on, Thistle! Get a grip on yourself! What are you on about?</p>
</div>

<p>Daub leans over toward Thistle, who takes a deep wavering breath.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>I'm very sorry for overhearing, but if I may?</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle nods.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>Did Clover as you to make this schedule? Or did you two work together to make this schedule?</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle shakes his head, looking off to the side.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>No. When I asked him, he didn't tell me what he wanted to do.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>That sounds like Clover.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>Far be it for me to tell you how to enjoy your con. It sounds like Clover just lives life on his own beat. Try out his rhythm for awhile, maybe?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Thistle, he doesn't care about a schedule, his clock very much runs on "Furry time".</p>
</div>

<p>Clover jogs up to the group.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Sorry about that, guys. Haven't seen that dude in years. Okay, Thistle. Hope I didn't put you too far behind schedule. What's next on the list?</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle looks at dauB then to Clover.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>What do you think about Go-karts?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(shrugging)</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>No, I mean, what do you really think?</p>
</div>

<p>Clover looks away for a moment in thought, then nods his head.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Hmm, yeah! It sounds really fun. I can't remember the last time I went on them.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover waves to Baz and dauB, they return it with smiles. Thistle waves at both, bowing his head a little when he waves at dauB. DauB mock tips a hat he doesn't wear. They disappear into the crowd, leaving Baz smiling at dauB.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>That was very kind of you.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(shrugging it off)</p>
<p>That's alright, I've been there before. Sounds like this is his first con?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(quiet)</p>
<p>Still, thanks.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>You're quite welcome--</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CHESTER (O.S.)</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(interrupting)</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
</div>

<p>Baz and dauB look up at CHESTER, a red Australian Shepherd with an orange bandana, vacant amber eyes, and matted ears that stick out to the side. Behind him, a huge, flashing, neon arrow blinks with the words "ART SHOW".</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CHESTER</h4>
<p>Can you guys tell me where the art show is?</p>
</div>

<p>Baz and dauB look at each other, completely befuddled. DauB raises up a finger to point in the direction of the sign. Chester turns around and walks in the way they pointed, rather than the direction the sign points.</p>



<h3>INT. THE GUEST ROOM - NIGHT</h3>

<p>Clover and Thistle walk through the guest room door. Clover carries a retail bag. Sahny rushes up to Clover.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>There you are! We're still good for tonight, right!?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Ah..sh-- that's right.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Oh, you're still on Thistle time?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Thistle? You okay with going out to parties?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Oh ... okay.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Yeah, Sahny and I usually party Saturday night.</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny pumps their chest and jumps on the bed.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>It's our tradition, man! C'mon! It's what we do!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(sigh)</p>
<p>It slipped my mind.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Well, that's okay!</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle grabs the bags from Clover.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>I will just get dressed and go with you.</p>
</div>

<h2>DISSOLVE TO:</h2>

<p>Sahny sprawls on their bed. They dart forward in a dramatic display of impatience.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(groaning)</p>
<p>Ugghhhhh, come onnnn alreadyyyyy!</p>
</div>

<p>Clover looks at his watch.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Relax, it's still early.</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny grabs a pillow, covers their face, and lets out a long, loud groan. Clover shakes his head. turning toward the closed bathroom door, he gives it a gentle knock.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(loud)</p>
<p>Hey bud, Sahny is getting antsy! You wanna meet us up there?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE (O.S.)</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(muffled through the door)</p>
<p>Oh... okay!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(dropping his head. loud)</p>
<p>We'll... We'll just be on the third floor! See you in a bit.</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny rushes over, grabbing Clover's arm as they head toward the door.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(impatient)</p>
<p>Okay. Cool. Let's goooooo!</p>
</div>

<p>The hotel room door can be heard closing. Thistle looks himself over in the mirror, dressed in a nice, faint green collared shirt and a simple, small tie. His hair combed and his fur brushed.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(quiet)</p>
<p>I guess I'll see you there...</p>
</div>

<p>He sighs. Adjusts his tie. Shapes his collar. Buttons up his sleeves. He sprays some cologne and coughs as he walks through the cloud.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(to himself, determined)</p>
<p>Maybe you'll see me the way I see you.</p>
</div>



<h3>INT. NOISY BLOCK - NIGHT</h3>


<h3>A PARTY ROOM</h3>

<p>Sahny summons a crowd, holding a red party cup in one hand, a shot glass in the other. A chanting crowd stands in a circle around the hyena. Sahny slams the shot, quickly consumes the one red cup, then exchanges it for another, downing it as well. Sahny shoots their arm into a victory pose, the crowd applauds and congratulates Sahny.</p>

<p>Clover sits in an armchair, watching Sahny's display. A scotch on the rocks in his hand. He swirls it, the ice clatters. He lets out a deep sigh, rubbing two fingers to his temple. Downs the last of his drink then looks at his watch. He sets the empty glass on the table and stands.</p>


<h3>HALLWAY</h3>

<p>Clover steps out into the hallway and looks in both directions. Party-goers flock along the walls. Clover looks at his watch. Then, turns to walk up the hallway.</p>


<h3>ELEVATOR CORRIDOR</h3>

<p>The elevator dings, the doors slide open. Thistle is crammed in an elevator. Several people flow out of the elevator, some in fursuit. Thistle shyly walks around them. One of them watches him pass, smirks, nods, and turns back to his friends.</p>


<h3>HALLWAY</h3>

<p>Thistle has his hand paws shoved deep into the pockets of his pressed slacks. He walks down the hallway with his shoulders pinned forward. He peeks into a party as the door cracks open. Then, turns away as a person walks out.</p>

<p>He continues down the hallway. He peeks through an open door. Music thumping inside the room. Sahny stumbles out into the hallway with a lampshade on their head, two red party cups in their hand paws. Lifting the lampshade with one of the cups, they meet eyes with Thistle.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(loud, slurring)</p>
<p>Thistle! Buddy! Come'ere. Watch what I can do!</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny wraps their arm around a hesitant Thistle's shoulder and pulls them into the room, they disappear behind the door.</p>

<p>A beat later, Clover exits a room with QUIN, a weasel with a vibrant blue fursuit partial on. Quin stumbles alongside Clover. Clover bracing Quin.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>QUIN</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(muffled, slurring)</p>
<p>It's... It's <span class="bold">mai birfday</span>. Di-Did you kn--</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(taking the fursuit head off)</p>
<p>Well, happy birthday. Why don't we get you to the bathroom?</p>
</div>

<p>Quin stumbles and falls down on one knee. Clover helps him back up. They start walking again. Clover gets him to the public bathroom on the floor. Propping the door open with his foot, he tries to help Quin enter. But, Quin stops just at the door and points obnoxiously close to Clover's face.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>QUIN</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(slurring)</p>
<p>Hey! Did... Did you know... It's my birthday?</p>
</div>

<p>Clover nods in false amazement, while forcefully pulling him into the bathroom.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>It is? Well, happy birthday. After you.</p>
</div>

<p>The bathroom door shuts behind Clover and Quin. A moment later Thistle and Sahny appear from out of the party room. Sahny rushing up the hallway to the next room, dragging Thistle.</p>



<h3>SECOND PARTY ROOM</h3>

<p>Loud music thumps in the room. Sahny returns the lampshade to the lamp while investigating the various bottles at a drink table. Thistle types on his phone. Sahny motions to get Thistle's attention. Thistle shakes his head, checking his phone again.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(shouting over music)</p>
<p>Hey Sahny! Where did Clover go?!</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny is in the midst of a calculated booze pour into a red cup. Without changing their focus, Sahny shrugs. Thistle sighs and turns away.</p>

<p>Thistle sits on the corner of a bed, which is shoved lengthwise against the wall. He checks his phone.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(to himself)</p>
<p>Oh, where are you?</p>
</div>

<p>To the beat of the music, Sahny dance-walks across the room in front of Thistle. Thistle watches them pass before focusing back to his phone.</p>

<p>On screen is a one-sided conversation to "Clover (last seen recently)" with the last few messages all marked as read.</p>

<p>Sahny wears a pink ocelot fursuit head as a hat, dancing in place, their drink spilling here and there.</p>

<p>Thistle leans his flop ear against the wall. His phone screen flashes on and off intermittently.</p>

<p>Sahny stumbles around with pants on their head, running circles around someone without pants.</p>

<p>Hollie sits next to Thistle on the bed. He continues to fidget with his phone. They share a short conversation, inaudible over the music. She offers him her drink, he politely refuses. He continues his fidgeting. His leg starts bouncing as they talk. She motions somewhere else in the room. He nods. She stands, her hand lingers on his shoulder for a few seconds past a simply friendly gesture. She walks away and he raises a paw to signal a half-hearted wave. He falls back into his phone watching.</p>

<p>Thistle presses the edge of his phone to his forehead.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(to himself)</p>
<p>Why won't you answer me?</p>
</div>

<p>The sound of Thistle's heartbeat grows, pounding in rhythm to the music.</p>

<p>Sahny is in the midst of telling some epic tale, as indicated by the dramatic body language in use.</p>

<p>Thistle's posture shrinks. His breathing heavier and heavier.</p>

<p>Sahny makes a hand motion, to which those gathered around the hyena laugh. Sahny continues the stories again.</p>

<p>Thistle taps the edge of his phone to his forehead. He looks up. His trembling eyes dance in the party lighting, tears swell.</p>

<p>Sahny shares more inaudible stories with a handsome crowd. Thistle runs past Sahny, who catches a glimpse of him running by. Sahny's story trails off as they stare blankly past the crowd. Shaking their head, they try to return to the story. But, trail off again. Sahny sighs and excuses themselves. Then, head out the door, cup in hand.</p>




<h3>EXT. F.U.R.S. ROOF - NIGHT</h3>

<p>The roof door swings open, Thistle rushes out to the edge of the rooftop, as the beginning piano chords of "Realization" echo in the open air. His eyes water as he looks out on the flickering orange lights of the cityscape beneath the silhouette of the mountains against the blue, moonlit night.</p>

<p>( MUSIC: "REALIZATION" )</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(to himself)</p>
<p>I guess I donʼt know what I was expecting. We barely know each other to begin with... and two days... What can you do?</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>Maybe I wanted more than he could give me.</p>
<p>Maybe we donʼt have all that much to say.</p>
<p>Maybe Iʼm nervous. Maybe he hates me.</p>
<p>Maybe Iʼm making it all too big a deal.</p>
<p>Iʼve been so open. Doesnʼt he owe me?</p>
<p>No. Maybe itʼs time to look within.</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny stands silhouetted in the incandescent glow of the hallway lighting behind them. Thistle hangs his head.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>Every dollar spent on this is feeling wasted.</p>
<p>All of the months of planning, building, orchestrating.</p>
<p>You were supposed to be my rock, my saving presence.</p>
<p>You were supposed to be my perfect iteration.</p>
<p>You were supposed to solve this crushing desperation.</p>
<p>You were supposed to be, you were supposed to be,</p>
<p>you were supposed to be the thing to fix it all!</p>
<p>Maybe Iʼm broken on the inside.</p>
<p>Too many hours spent online.</p>
<p>All of the structures I put into place,</p>
<p>have only served to compromise my health.</p>
<p>Maybe Iʼm working with the wrong guy.</p>
<p>Maybe I have to grow myself.</p>
<p>Under construction.</p>
<p>Under the impression,</p>
<p>that one weekend was the antidote,</p>
<p>the fix for all the things I broke,</p>
<p>the ever-growing manifold of,</p>
<p>issues I cannot withhold.</p>
<p>Youʼll hardly recognize the mold here, once Iʼm done.</p>
<p>Maybe go all the way.</p>
<p>Maybe Iʼll... Maybe...</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(whisper)</p>
<p>Iʼm sorry.</p>
</div>

<p>( END: "REALIZATION" )</p>

<p>The cold midnight glow surrounds the scene. Sahny stands astonished.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(soft)</p>
<p>Damn, dude... That's heavy.</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle rubs his eyes, turning his face away.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Sorry. I don't know what got into me.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(quiet, stepping closer)</p>
<p>You ... you wanna talk ‘bout it?</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle sits on the ledge, facing inward.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Mm, I don't want to bother you.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>It's alright, sounds like you've got some ... stuff.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Yeah, I do. I feel so messed up inside.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>I hear ya.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Have you ever wanted to be with someone, but they don't want you?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(look to the side)</p>
<p>That's not really my thing.</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(scratching their head)</p>
<p>But, in a way, I guess I do.</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle scoots off the ledge to sit on the ground, wrapping his arms around his legs.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>I think he hates me.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(looking into the sky)</p>
<p>Clover? Nah, dude. Clover, he's like the best, most caring person ever! But, he's ... been through some stuff.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>I wish I could be more like you... You seem so free.</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny sets down their red party cup and gives Thistle a confident smirk.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Well, I am pretty awesome.</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny chuckles, then grows quiet for a beat.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>But... I'm not free of issues. I have a fair share.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny sits alongside Thistle on the ground.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(sighs)</p>
<p>Oh, you know... Nobody's perfect. You should see Baz's old art, oh man! Or my early suiting videos, I used to think dancing in suit was just swinging my hips to the beat.</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny shakes their head and scoffs. Sahny doodles in the dirt with their finger.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>I'll never forget the time Clover got launched back over a technical malfunction, his hands were black for the entire weekend!</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny laughs. Thistle listens intently to the hyena's uncharacteristically wise words.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Relationships are tough, man. Friendships are too! If things went right the first time, everyone in the world would be without the experiences that make them who they are.</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle looks as he's digesting the words and mulling them over.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>You shouldn't let Clover bring you down. Clover's ... Clover. He'll come around.</p>
</div>

<p>Thistle nods and gazes up at the stars. The two share a quiet moment. Until the yeen stands up, clapping the dust off their hands.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>That's enough of that! We're around like-minded peeps. Let's get our drink on, boiiiii! Okay?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(nodding)</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny reaches out a hand paw. Thistle grabs it and Sahny pulls him to his feet.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>You shouldn't let Clover bring you down. Clover's ... Clover. He'll come around.</p>
</div>

<p>They walk towards the entrance.</p>



<h3>EXT. SAFE HAVEN ZOO - NIGHT</h3>

<p>Warm lamplight glows on the path that Baz and dauB walk on. All around them are trees in between animal cages. They are in the midst of conversation that seems more interesting to them than the animals around. Baz carries her messenger bag and dauB clutches his sketchbook.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Hmm, I can't say. I think the earliest I remember seeing horses was in the Westerns my pop would watch. Then, when we moved and I got to see them in real life, then I was hooked! What about you, what about your 'sona? What even is your 'sona?</p>
</div>

<p>DauB rubs the back of his neck as they continue to walk.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>I'm a bit shy about this.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Oh, come on!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>A tabby.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Like a house cat?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(bashful)</p>
<p>I want to be a smol kitty.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>I'm sorry, but that is absolutely adorable. Why, though?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>Why? Well...</p>
</div>

<p>He hesitates as he gazes up at the stars. Baz slows, looking at him with concern.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>I don't like being tall. I'm afraid of breaking things, or hurting someone. I don't fit in anywhere.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Come on, you can fit in with our group.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>No! I mean, I don't fit <span class="italic">in</span> things. The hotel bed is too small, my feet get cold.</p>
</div>

<p>He cracks a faint smile. Baz looks him over, then smiles too. She turns her head shying away, pressing her cheek to her shoulder.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>When you mentioned the drawing at the zoo, I imagined the other type. You know, with artists.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>Oh, ha! No, this is the type of zoo I like! Ah, here's a good spot.</p>
</div>

<p>In front of a cage with a sparkling blue pool, dauB places his sketchbook on a picnic table. Baz joins him, placing down her phone and sketchbook. The moon hangs low in the sky, just above the cage's clear plastic walls.</p>

<p>She reads over the phone screen for a moment. She gives an exaggerated groan, tugging her cheek fluff.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Ugh! Who am I kidding?!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>Huh?</p>
</div>

<p>Baz folds her arms on the table and hides her face in them.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(muffled)</p>
<p>I can't do this.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>Whoa, what is it?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(muffled)</p>
<p>This is too much to do in one night! Mmmmnh! I'm done for.</p>
</div>

<p>Daub places a hand on her back for a moment. Noticing his hand, he pulls it back and rubs his palm close to his chest.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>Sorry.</p>
</div>

<p>Baz lifts her head with determination on her face.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(resolute)</p>
<p>No, it's okay. I skived off yesterday. And now, I get to deal with it.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>May I help?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>It's quite alright. I wouldn't put that on you.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>I know you can do it. But, in honesty, I would cherish the opportunity.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Don't you have commissions too?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>Of course, but for my style it takes more than a weekend. My commissioners know that I'm usually slow about the sketching part.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Oh! Well, I excel at sketching. Slow at inking, though.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>I'll have you know, that I am the fastest pen in the west! Pew pew!</p>
</div>

<p>Baz covers her mouth as she giggles at his finger guns.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(like John Wayne)</p>
<p>Settle down there, pilgrim! You can start by--</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(coughs)</p>
<p>Okay, I can't do that voice. I sketched these during our dinner, can you ink these? I'll help.</p>
</div>

<p>Daub smirks at her impression, and graciously accepts the badge sketches with both hands. He dips a pen into an ink jar. He places the pen to the paper and draws out a confident stroke on top of a sketch easily recognizable in Baz's style.</p>

<p>( MUSIC: "DRAW ME IN" )</p>

<p>Daub taps out the beginning of "DRAW ME IN" with a pen. A little otters floats in the pool behind them and toots on a tiny sax to join in the music. With the cymbal crash, the otter dives into the water with a splash. The darkness of the park fades away. Baz and dauB fall gracefully from their seats through a painted world that blends their two styles. The pens in their hands draw out black ribbons that dance around them as they duet and dance close together.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>Hand me a pen.</p>
<p>I'm 'bout a thousand lines away,</p>
<p>from getting to bed, but I struggle to care.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>Out from the dark, out of the corner of my eye,</p>
<p>I see the spark, that first got me to dare.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ AND DAUB</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>To think out from underneath this pile of ref sheets still to go. The work seems easier, you make it easier to let go!</p>

<p>I like money, but prefer your attention!</p>
<p>Draw me in. It's where I want to be drawn.</p>
</div>

<p>The badge images fading in and out.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>Ugh, this guy's markings are ridiculous.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Let me see... Ooh, yeah. What help with the stripes?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>Please!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>Lucky for us, the zoo doesn't close till 3am.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">

<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>You call that luck?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">

<p>Beats disturbing your roommates.</p>

<p>True.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ AND DAUB</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>Tell me who would pick this job, or is it the kind of job that picks you?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">

<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>It's time to laminate!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>Alright. So -- ah crap! Do you have a hole punch?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Yeah! Do you have any badge clips?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>I'm not the most prepared person.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing, giggles)</p>
<p>It's fine have some of mine.</p>
<p>I really don't know how this con would have gone without you.</p>
</div>

<p>The painted world fades as they gently touch down in their seats.</p>

<p>( END: "DRAW ME IN" )</p>

<p>After the song fades, the two look into one another's eyes, smiling. DauB leans in.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>Me neither.</p>
</div>

<p>They both turn back to their badges, smiling from ear to ear.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Thank you so much for lending a hand.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAUB</h4>
<p>I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
</div>



<h3>INT. THE GUEST ROOM - NIGHT</h3>

<p>Decked in a black spandex suit, Sahny kneels next to an opened plastic bin in the guest room. They pull out a plush, purple, deer fursuit. A balaclava wrapping around their face.</p>

<p>Thistle stares at his phone in his hand. He clicks the screen on. The SocialCreature app is opened to the same conversation with Clover from earlier. Clover still hasn't responded. Thistle clicks the screen off. Stares at it for a moment. Closing his eyes, takes a long, deep breath. Then, tosses the phone onto the bed.</p>

<p>Thistle turns to Sahny, crossing the room with the purple mass of fur in their arms. Piano intro bit starts up as they connect eyes.</p>

<p>( MUSIC: "I'M GOING ALL IN" )</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Oh my <span class="italic">god</span>, I'm so ready!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>You're getting in suit?</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny steps into the bathroom, the light clicks on.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY (O.S.)</h4>
<p>I, mean, yeah. It's Saturday night!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Oh geeze... how hard are we going tonight?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Well...</p>
</div>

<p>Piano bit ends. Sahny steps out of the bathroom, the body suit already on. They make their way across the room, to the bins, as they sing.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>I'm going all in!</p>
<p>Till I can't anymore!</p>
<p>Till parts of me I didn't know could be...</p>

<p>I worked for my money!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Sahny.</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny whips around to look at Thistle and with quite a bit of sass, zips up the body suit.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>'eeeeeeeeeey don't you tell me!</p>
<p>It isn't every day that you turn twenty-three!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>You're twenty-eight and your birthday was weeks ago--</p>
</div>

<p>In a dramatic gesture, Sahny points straight up.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(sung, interrupting)</p>
<p>Brrrrrrrring me my cup, 'til I throw up!</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny leans over and produces a beer can from the upturned foam deer head, holds it out, cracks the tab, and swigs.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>I'm going alright! I'm going all night! I'm going all in!</p>
</div>



<h3>INT. NOISY BLOCK - NIGHT</h3>

<p>Thistle and Sahny approach a hotel room door.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>What kind of party is this again?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>You'll have to be more specific. What's the first room number?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>1142</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>I don't remember. Let's go!</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Right behind ya! er... actually, you should probably follow me.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Alright. Here. We. Go!</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny knocks three times, the door creaks open. Party noises can be heard inside the room.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>'ey!</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>I'm going all out</p>
<p>Bring on the shots</p>
<p>There are no laws if you're wearing paws</p>

<p>I got my chalice and a 3 foot straw</p>

<p>lord you ain't ready for all this sass</p>
<p>I'm going alright!</p>
<p>I'm going all night!</p>
<p>I'm going all iiiiin!</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(spoken)</p>
<p>Next room! This one's the underwear party. Are you wearing underwear?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>I... yes?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Good! Me too. In my pocket. Lemme just ... get these on...</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Over your fursuit? I never got the point of that. How does <span class="italic">adding</span> clothing somehow make this seem dirty?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Look! We're here. Roll with it.</p>
</div>

<p>Sahny knocks three times, the door creaks open. Party noises can be heard inside the room.</p>

<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>'ey!</p>

<h3>INT. F.U.R.S HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT</h3>

<p>Clover holds his phone at eye level, tilting it as if to catch some indoor rain. Diego hastily walks around the corner. He slides behind the bear as Clover spins in place, still holding his phone out. He doubletakes as he sees Diego out of the corner of his eye.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Oh hey, Diego!</p>
</div>

<p>Diego jerks around.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Clover! Hey! I'm making rounds. It's good to see you're still hanging in there.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>You heard about that, huh?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(animated)</p>
<p>Oh yeah, gossip. So, I gotta run. Someone reported some kids hanging out on the roof. I'm gonna make sure that door gets locked.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Isn't that the hotel's job?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Well, if you want things done right, gotta do it yourself. Am I right? Anywho, I'll catch ya later.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover looks at his phone.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Hey, I'll come with you! I've been struggling to get signal.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Hah, yep. I've been told all about the wifi problems. And heck yeah! It'd be good to chat.</p>
</div>

<p>They walk together at Diego's pace. Clover pockets his phone.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Oh man, it's good seeing you! It's been forever! You did stop volunteering and disappeared.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Hey, the con kept moving time and locations. Hard to keep up.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Oh, come on, you know how it is. One place cancels your contract last minute. One won't lock down a date. Always some nonsense.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>If I recall right, one place kicked ya out because <span class="italic">you</span> were screwing with the sprinkler system.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(animated exasperation)</p>
<p>I was <span class="italic">trying</span> to generate a cool mist to keep con-goers happy in the heat!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>That doesn't make any sense, Diego.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(bowing his head)</p>
<p>Well, it did at the time.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>You're nuts!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Nuts 'bout the ladies!</p>
</div>

<p>Clover snickers through his teeth, shaking his head.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Whatever, man. Say, you still in that band?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Nah. They cramped my style!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(doubtful)</p>
<p>Really now? It seemed to me like they were a perfect match for you.</p>
</div>

<p>As the two take the corner, behind them is Sahny with Thistle wrapped in one arm. They walk in the opposite direction away from Clover and the gray yeen.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Okay, truth be told, I do miss it. But, been so busy with all this con chair stuff ever since Zero stepped down. I really should quit too. Karen would be way better at this than me.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Who's Karen?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>You remember Keith?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>What? No way! That's so awesome! I knew she was thinking about it. So happy for her.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(thoughtful)</p>
<p>Yeah, me too. She's been my rock.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>She must be strong if she puts up with your nonsense.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Ain't that the truth. Ah! Here's the roof access.</p>
</div>

<p>Diego jiggles the handle, the door creaks open. Pushing on the door, Diego peaks around the door. Then walks through, followed by Clover.</p>



<h3>EXT. F.U.R.S. ROOF - NIGHT</h3>

<p>Diego does a half-hearted search of the surrounding rooftop and behind obvious hiding spots.</p>

<p>Clover walks past him, holding his phone out. The notification chimes. He reads the screen.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(growling)</p>
<p>Tsk, dammit!</p>
</div>

<p>Diego turns his attention to his friend.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>What's that about?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>What? Oh, it's nothing. I missed some important texts.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(teasing)</p>
<p>From all your <span class="italic">lovers</span>?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Uh...</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(joyous)</p>
<p>Wait. No way? Ah, you beast!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>It's not like that! Well, kind of. Maybe. Ugh! I dunno.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Clover, bouncing back! Ah, good on you, dude.</p>
</div>

<p>Diego bounces on his toe pads like a boxer, throwing a few mock jabs in the air. Clover leans his bear butt on the roof ledge. His paws deep in his slack pockets. He sighs and kicks an empty red party cup left out on the ground.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(quiet)</p>
<p>Truthfully, it hasn't been that easy.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover folds his arms.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Here I've found some guy that's decent and makes me excited for life again. Makes me feel <span class="italic">something</span> again. And I still can't help but think I'm going to <span class="bold">cuss everything up</span> all over.</p>
</div>

<p>His arm tighten.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(agitated, shaky)</p>
<p>The breakup left me so tired and broken. Friendless. Passionless. And utterly helpless! I hate feeling this way! I want to move past this. I want to--</p>
</div>

<p>With a grunt, Clover shields his face with a paw.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>-- Sorry. You don't wanna hear me rant.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Dude, it's fine. Vent if you need! But, you gotta know, you were <span class="italic">never</span> friendless. We were always here for you. You didn't have to be volunteering for us to care about you! Karen, Dash, Rojo, King. Even me. No matter what happens, you can't run away from us again!</p>
</div>

<p>Clover nods, bending over to pick up the empty red party cup.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Thanks. I'm sorry I left.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Come back to us any time you want.</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(persuading)</p>
<p>Like next year maybe?</p>
</div>

<p>Clover scoffs and gives Diego a wary glare.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>What? I know you enjoy it.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>I'll come back when you stop micromanaging everyone, how's that for ya?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Micromanaging? Come on, I don't do that!</p>
</div>

<p>Clover hops to his feet.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Oh, yeah you do!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Noooo. I don't.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>I know you! I bet you've been running around needlessly <span class="italic">taking care</span> of things all weekend. And let me guess, you haven't even written your closing ceremonies speech yet, have you?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>I haven't had time! You know how things are. I've had to attend to four different disasters in the last hour alone.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(doubtful)</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Eh, I always write it Sunday morn--</p>
</div>

<p>Clover plants a hand on Diego's shoulder, right by the scruff.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(interrupting, stern)</p>
<p>And it's always been shit!</p>
</div>

<p>Diego is taken back.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Woah, dude.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(stern)</p>
<p>Look at yourself! You're sleep deprived. Your hair is a greasy mess, your eyes are bloodshot, and you're fiddling with that radio like it's the One Ring. You do this to yourself every year!</p>
</div>

<p>Diego lets out a long sigh being interrupted by the radio.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>VOLUNTEER (OVER RADIO)</h4>
<p>Con-Ops, I've got a <span class="italic">Dan</span> here. A snow leopard who can't get himself out of a tree.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>HAWKUS (OVER RADIO)</h4>
<p>Did you say Dan?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>VOLUNTEER (OVER RADIO)</h4>
<p>Yes, out by the pool entrance. It sounds like he had a bit of <span class="italic">something</span>. I think he's trying to go to sleep up there.</p>
</div>

<p>Diego brings the radio up to his muzzle, but hesitates. The hyena stares long into the night as the radio barks out once more.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>HAWKUS (OVER RADIO)</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(exasperated)</p>
<p>What? Ah okay, I'll track down a ladder and--</p>
</div>

<p>Click, Deigo turns off his radio. He stares blankly into the silence, clenching his jaw. Clover pats him on the back.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>There you go. Let your team handle this. They're there so <span class="italic">you</span> can do things like write your goddamn speech.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover jostles Diego's shoulder.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Feelin' better after shutting that damn thing off?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>No.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Ya will. Once you get a good night's sleep. Ya hear me?</p>
</div>

<p>Diego rolls his eyes with an affirmative and comical head wobble.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(mocking)</p>
<p>Yes, dad.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(laughing)</p>
<p>You remind me of another friend of mine. What is it with you yeens?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>You love us!</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>That I do. But I also remember <span class="italic">not</span> liking you at first.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Whaaa?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>You were always so obnoxious. Well, okay that hasn't changed. But, I've grown accustomed to it now!</p>
</div>

<p>Diego stares up at the bear with dismay. His mouth trembles.</p>

<p>Then, he cackles and playfully shoves Clover. He leans against the ledge of the roof. And with a content sigh, they both smile through a moment of silence.</p>

<p>Diego breaks that silence with a yawn, joined by Clover. Both yawning as only a hyena and bear would do.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(tired)</p>
<p>Okay, I surrender. I'll try to get some sleep.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Yeah, me too.</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(looking at his phone)</p>
<p>I need to talk to Thistle tomorrow.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>I wish you the best, man. You deserve to be happy.</p>
</div>

<p>Diego does a push-up off the ledge, launching himself into a spin. Now facing towards the door, he lifts an arm up high and flicks a quick wave.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>We'll talk soon! 'Til then, g'nite.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Good night, bud.</p>
</div>

<p>Clover looks out onto the horizon. Sighs deeply. Rubs his fuzzy forehead. Then, turns and walks away.</p>

<h2>FADE OUT.</h2>
