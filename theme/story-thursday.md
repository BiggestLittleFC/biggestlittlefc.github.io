<p>SUPERIMPOSE: "Thursday"</p>
<p>FADE IN:</p>
<h3>EXT. RENO, NEVADA ABOVE F.U.R.S. - DAY</h3>
<p>A small SPARROW soars through clear blue skies. Wind rushes through its feathers. It glides over a small city surrounded by snowcapped indigo mountains. Its wings flutter and it dives into the valley.</p>
<p>( MUSIC : "OVERTURE" )</p>
<p>The "OVERTURE" swells as the bird flies down the side of the FORTUNA URSINE RESORT &amp; SPA (F.U.R.S.), a large hotel in the middle of the city with alabaster walls, gilded windows, and glimmering lights. At ground level, the sparrow ducks between busy workers hastily moving crates and various construction materials. The sparrow perches on a plastic crate atop a cart pulled by an individual with the word "VOLUNTEER" in white on their back. Glass doors open and the volunteer pulls the cart through.</p>
<h3>INT. F.U.R.S. - CONTINUOUS</h3>
<p>HALLWAY</p>
<p>Inside, light gleams through large windows into a hallway lined with several joyful volunteers, performing tasks, moving in unison to the beat of the overture (0:20). Past them, a set of double doors swing open to a large auditorium. The volunteer pulling the cart continues through the doors.</p>
<p>MAIN STAGE</p>
<p>Purple curtains flank a large performance stage. DIEGO, a frazzled, gray-spotted hyena with intense yellow eyes stands on the main stage directing with dramatic hand movements. He barks orders that cannot be heard over the continued overture. The bird flies up as the cart clatters over some power cables stretched out across the floor. Diego turns toward backstage, the bird flies past him and disappears into the ceiling supports.</p>
<p>Diego's tail stands straight out as he raises his hands up. The purple curtain lifts to reveal irregular rectangle structures on the back of the stage. Diego snaps his finger and each rectangle, of a different color, lights up. Diego gestures and the color bars are hoisted up by ropes. The background fades out, leaving only the colored bars, the title fades in over.</p>
<p>TITLE OVER:</p>
<p class="centered"><span class="underline">ONE WEEKEND</span></p>
<h2>FADE TO:</h2>
<h3>INT. THISTLE'S APARTMENT - DAY</h3>
<p>The title suspends in front of a white door inside a well-lit studio apartment which is highly maintained, if not for the mess of clothes strewn about the bed and floor. Carelessly the pile is settled next to a backpack and an overly-full wheeled suitcase. The logo fades away with the overture.</p>
<p>Outside the apartment, the sound of somebody running up a stairwell and down a hallway can be heard. The noise comes to a halt just as it reaches the door. With the jangle of keys and the clunk of a deadbolt, the door opens. THISTLE runs through the door and up to a wooden dresser in the center of the room. He slides open a drawer and frantically pulls out various shirts and throws them over his shoulder.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(worried)</p>
<p>Oh, where did it go?</p>
</div>
<p>Thistle throws a few other shirts onto the bed.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(triumphant)</p>
<p>Ah-HA!! There you are!</p>
</div>
<p>Thistle holds up a green and yellow shirt. It unfolds to reveal the text "Good Boix" in cursive typeface printed on the front. He bunches up the shirt and hugs it, squeezing it to his cheek fluff with a big smile. He caresses it for a moment. Without a second thought the dark blue work polo is stripped, and he quickly dawns the Good Boix shirt, tail wagging all the while.</p>
<p>He shoulders the backpack and wheels the suitcase out into the hallway. He pauses to look into his apartment, takes a deep breath, then shuts the door.</p>
<h3>EXT. GAS STATION - DAY</h3>
<p>CLOVER, a mature polar bear with a dad-bod and sport coat, leans against his car. A gas pump chugs fuel into a beat-up, paint-worn SUV. He thumbs out a message on his phone.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER (TEXT)</h4>
<p>Just fueling up. On my way to pick you up. Please be ready this time.</p>
</div>
<h3>INT. SAHNY'S APARTMENT â€“ DAY</h3>
<p>A young, brown-spotted hyena with bright-colored attire and the overall demeanor of an avid partier, SAHNY lounges on their couch. They review a mound of alcohols, fursuit props, and vibrant furry masses packed away in and around plastic storage bins. A phone nearby buzzes. Sahny reads over it and snickers. The hyena tips the bottom of their phone up to their mouth and speaks into it.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Yeah, yeah, old man. Let's see if your clunker can even make it here.</p>
</div>
<p>On screen is the conversation between Sahny and Clover on an app called SocialCreature. Sahny navigates to the "posts" section of the app.</p>
<div class="dialogue">

</div>
<p>Sahny groans and flops backward on the couch. They play with their phone and speak into it once more.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Baaazzzz, make me art! I got like 20 watchers the last time.</p>
</div>
<p>Their phone chimes.</p>
<h3>INT. BAZ'S PLACE - DAY</h3>
<p>BAZ, a sergal with clothing as bold as her fur is gray, sits in a computer chair. She slurps from a noodle cup. Sahny's message is on the SocialCreature desktop app. She scoffs and types on her keyboard with one hand.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>ON SCREEN</h4>
<p>
<span class="bold">BAZERI - TABLE 22 @ FURSUASION<br>I can't work for free... Give me da money, Sahny!</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>Baz slurps a noodle. Little bits of juice sprinkle on the desk next to some various crushed beverage cans and emptied noodle cartons. In the background, a campy old western plays on a TV. The computer dings and a small notification appears in the bottom right corner of the screen. She leans toward it.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>ON SCREEN</h4>
<p>
<span class="bold">Email received: Overdue payment, FINAL NOTICE</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>Baz sets down the noodle cup. She places her hand to her brow, closes her eyes, leans back, and sighs.</p>
<h3>INT. AIRPORT #1 - DAY</h3>
<p>Thistle stands with his wheeled suitcase and backpack in front of gigantic windows overlooking an airport runway. A commercial aircraft rolls into a gate. Thistle reads over a boarding pass. He closes his eyes takes a slow, deep breath. The opening chords for "ONE WEEKEND" strum in. He sings and dances across the terminal.</p>
<p>( MUSIC : "ONE WEEKEND" )</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>Perhaps my expectations aren't realistic.<br>To think that any single conference could defy,<br>a trend a decade long where I rot working retail.<br>And now I'm giving up before it all begins!<br>One weekend where I can finally have a say.<br>One weekend that lets me get out and away.<br>So as I clutch an airline ticket and a suitcase, say a prayer for my one weekend. One, three-day weekend.<br>One weekend, all it takes to find and make the place you want to live in.<br>One weekend, time enough to find the stuff you're missing out on.<br>One weekend, every issue, every problem, every complication.<br>One weekend, give me just a few more days so I can get my.<br>One weekend. One weekend. One weekend!</p>
</div>
<h3>INT. BAZ'S PLACE - DAY</h3>
<p>Baz kicks away from her desk and spins in her chair as she opens with her lines. She continues dancing around her room on, around, and with her furniture.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>I have a problem, with my bank account!<br>Buy my commissions! It's what this con is all about!<br>I might get paid this time.<br>Soon they'll all wait in line for ME.<br>this one weekend.<br>One weekend.<br>One weekend, time to make it back, the flights, the rooms, the gasoline.<br>One weekend, draw and sketch and sell my soul to pay the bills.<br>One weekend, sure this can be fun but overall this is a business.<br>One weekend, God, I hope you've all been saving up for this.<br>One weekend.<br>One weekend.</p>
</div>
<h3>EXT. SAHNY'S APARTMENT - DAY</h3>
<p>Clover and Sahny load up the SUV while dancing with Sahny's luggage and props.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>Don't worry darlin. It'll all be fine.<br>I've checked every box, this train is runnin', and it's runnin' on time!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>You think all my suits will fit?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>If we take out the boxes of wine.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Hey! I need those!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>You can take 2.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>I need all 8 for the game to work!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Okay, 4.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Ugh! Fine. I can make this work, at least for</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY AND CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>One weekend</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>Where the guys will turn their heads when they hear I'm coming!</p>

<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>One Weekend</p>

<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>Maybe <span class="italic">this</span> year you can find your way back to your bed <span class="italic">alone</span>
</p>

<div class="dialogue">

<p>Reno hasnâ€™t gotten over what <span class="italic">I</span> did there last year</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(sung, simultaneous)</p>
<p>Reno hasn't gotten over what we did there last year</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY AND CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(sung)</p>
<p>One Weekend.<br>And you know that we can't wait to do it all again<br>One weekend. This weekend!</p>
</div>
<p>Both sit inside the SUV. The door slams and the music becomes muffled as if it's in the SUV.</p>
<p>( END: "ONE WEEKEND" )</p>
<h3>INT. CLOVER'S SUV - DAY</h3>
<p>Clover clutches the wheel at the "ten-n-two". 80's rock plays low on the radio. Sahny scrolls down on their phone. Clover clears his throat and leans toward Sahny.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Okay, so you can take shotgun for the drive to Baz's, but then you're on your own.<br>
</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(chuckles)</p>
<p>Hope the wine can support your weight!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Ha! I'll just drink it all to make some room!</p>
</div>
<p>Sahny smirks. Clover looks over at them with a face of annoyance, that fades to parental disappointment.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Kidding!</p>
</div>
<p>Sahny gives a "what" gesture, shakes their head, and turns their attention back to their phone. Clover rolls his eyes, shifts his weight, and rests his head on his arm propped against the driver window.</p>
<h3>EXT. BAZ'S PLACE - DAY</h3>
<p>Clover's SUV rolls into the parking lot and parks next to Baz standing on the sidewalk with her backpack and messenger bag. Sahny opens the SUV door and hugs Baz.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Hey, Sahny.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Yooo.</p>
</div>
<p>Sahny reluctantly squeezes themselves up and over the plastic bins of their numerous suits, having to shift two of their three fursuit heads to press against the rear windshield. The ceiling of the SUV is almost a comfortable pressure. And with a nervous laugh and some effort, they are able to secure the phone that was previously in their pocket. Clover looks over at Baz's bag with a suspicious eyebrow raised.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Is that all you're bringing?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Yup. The backpack is clean clothes. The rest, I had shipped from my last con to the hotel.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Ah, Spiffy. But, ainâ€™t that expensive?</p>
</div>
<p>Baz sits with her bags at her feet. And as if she didnâ€™t hear the question, looks in the back at Sahny pressed against the roof.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Are you sure you'll be okay back there your highness? Should we get you a better throne?</p>
</div>
<p>Sahny blows raspberries, not looking up from their phone. Baz smiles, turns forward, and pulls out her phone.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(posh accent)</p>
<p>Hmm, not very regal.</p>
</div>
<p>The SUV drives away.</p>
<h3>INT. AIRPLANE #1 - DAY</h3>
<p>Thistle sits in a window seat of a plane. He buries his muzzle into the top of the backpack clutched tightly in his lap. He takes long, deep breaths. His eyes, extra wide and staring into the distance through the window. His ears flat against his head.</p>
<p>FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1, a short gray ferret with kind eyes, leans in.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1</h4>
<p>Sir? Excuse me sir?</p>
</div>
<p>Thistle looks up towards her. She points down at his bag.</p>
<p>FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1, a short gray ferret with kind eyes, leans in.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1</h4>
<p>I'm sorry sir. But, you'll have to stow your bag under the seat in front of you before take-off.</p>
</div>
<p>Thistle looks down at the bag and loosens his grip on it.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(quiet, shaky)</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(smiles)</p>
<p>First time?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(quiet)</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1</h4>
<p>I can get you some peanuts, would that help?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Oh, I can't have peanuts. But, if you have some crackers, that'd be nice.</p>
</div>
<p>She smiles, nods, and walks away. Thistle tucks his bag under the seat in front him.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>PILOT (INTERCOM)</h4>
<p>Uhhhhhhh, folks! This is your captain speaking. Looks like we've run into uhhh delay. There's uhhhhh deer on the runway.</p>
</div>
<p>Thistle looks astounded at the intercom speaker, his floppy ears perked, eyes wide and concerned. The pilot is drowned out as Thistle's side of the plane grows louder with shouts and laughter. Thistle blinks, looking out the window.</p>
<p>A naked deer runs across the view of Thistle's window being chased by airport security.</p>
<p>Thistle glows bright red, he covers his eyes and blindly pulls down the window screen, just in time for the flash from the airport security taser. The other passengers shout out a "OOOH!".</p>
<p>Thistle fidgets with his phone's tactile buttons, blankly staring past the screen. He shakes it off when the attendant returns with a few packs of crackers.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(to himself)</p>
<p>Here you are sweetie. Oh, I'm sorry, but I'll have to ask you to turn your phone off during this flight. As soon as they clean up the fuss outside, we'll be taking off.</p>
</div>
<p>Thistle thanks the nice lady with a brief smile and nod. Opening the packet of crackers, he places one on his tongue and holds it in his mouth.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(to himself)</p>
<p>Okay, take-off.</p>
</div>
<p>The plane starts rolling across the tarmac. Thistle takes a deep breath. Some garbled message over the intercom is drown out by the sound of his breathing. The plane rounds a corner and halts. The engines' whir builds to a full roar. He grabs the edge of the armrest. The plane rumbles as it gains speed down the runway. He presses against the seat. His breath grows shorter, louder. The murmur of the rest of the passengers is but a hush. The plane tips up. Thistle presses even harder against the seat, his claws dig into the armrest. He takes a deep breath, closes his eyes.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(whispers)</p>
<p>For Clover.</p>
</div>
<p>His breath softens as the plane's rumbles smooths out to steady swaying in the air. Thistle remains with his eyes closed, pressed against the seat. His legs bouncing.</p>
<p>He takes a deep breath and his eyes peel open to glance at the window shade. He reaches toward the shade, hesitates. Then, eases the shade to reveal the sun shining across a clear blue sky. Below, a scene like a Bob Ross painting with fluffy white clouds, lines etching out roads on a green landscape of lush fields, and happy little trees.</p>
<p>Thistle looks on with awe. His face nearly pressed to the window, tear shimmering in his eye and the biggest of all smiles.</p>
<p>He turns back to his seat, pulling out his phone. He pauses and returns it to his pocket. Turning again to the view.</p>
<h2>DISSOLVE TO:</h2>
<p>Thistle reclines with his tray table down, reading from an in-flight catalog of useless novelties. The seat belt indicator bings over head. He glances up, sets his magazine aside and locks his tray table in place. He peeks out the window.</p>
<p>The plane is engulfed in layers of white as it passes through the middle of a cloud. It breaks through the cloud to reveal patches of residential areas below. An inaudible mumble of the captain barks out over the intercom. Strips of land blend into the surrounding sea. The whole sight seems a million miles down.</p>
<p>Thistle leans away from the window, looking as if he's about to faint. He claps his hand to his forehead, sighing. He takes a deep breath and closes the window blind. Grabbing the arm rests, he presses into his seat.</p>
<p>The plane rumbles as it touches down. Thistle jumps. The plane slows down and the engine whine quiets. The garbled message of the audio over head, to about the only clear thing said.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>PILOT (INTERCOM)</h4>
<p>... you may switch on your mobile device and ...</p>
</div>
<p>Thistle doesn't hesitate in whipping his device out, slamming down on the power button until that welcome message flashes and the home screen renders. He breathes a sigh of relief as his posture relaxes. He wipes his palm to his eye. He shoots forward, gripping his phone with both hands.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(muttering)</p>
<p>No, no, no, no!</p>
</div>
<p>Frantically digging through his bag, he pulls out a boarding pass and reads it over. He looks at his phone screen, and back to the document. He throws his hands on top of his head.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Oh, no!</p>
</div>
<p>He scrambles his belt loose. Grabs his backpack and runs up the aisles. He gets near the front before the LEAD FLIGHT ATTENDANT, a heavy-set badger who looks very crowded in the small aircraft, blocks the aisle with her palm out.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>LEAD FLIGHT ATTENDANT</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(stern)</p>
<p>Sir! You <span class="italic">need</span> to sit down!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>No, you don't understand!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>LEAD FLIGHT ATTENDANT</h4>
<p>No. Sir, you don't understand. You need to sit down!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Please! My next flight is in ten minutes!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>LEAD FLIGHT ATTENDANT</h4>
<p>Okay, but you need to sit until we stop.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(pointing)</p>
<p>Here's an empty seat.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>LEAD FLIGHT ATTENDANT</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(rolling her eyes)</p>
<p>Fine, just please sit.</p>
</div>
<p>Thistle plants himself in the empty seat she pointed out, clasping his bag and bouncing his feet.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>LEAD FLIGHT ATTENDANT</h4>
<p>What's your next flight, we can try to call ahead.</p>
</div>
<p>Thistle shows her the boarding pass. She glances at it.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>LEAD FLIGHT ATTENDANT</h4>
<p>That's not even the same airline! But, I'll see what I can do.</p>
</div>
<p>The plane docks with the terminal. Flight attendant #1 opens the door. Thistle shoots out of the opening, running down the corridor.</p>
<h2>MATCH CUT TO:</h2>
<h3>INT. F.U.R.S. - DAY</h3>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>KAREN</h4>
<p>Looking at the volunteers available today, load in should be real smooth.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Karen, I can't focus on this right now! My blood pressure can't take any bad news! I need to make sure Con Ops got those printers over to Reg, then I need to get over and make sure the panel rooms are all set!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>KAREN</h4>
<p>Shouldnâ€™t you be talking to the hotel?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Oh, the hotel.  I can't even imagine how much more the hotel is going to charge us after these renovations, they even <span class="italic">finished</span> the pool! I donâ€™t even want to think about it.</p>
</div>
<p>Diego stops to rub his temples and nervously runs his fingers through his disheveled hair again letting out a long yawn. He pauses long enough for Karen to interject.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>KAREN</h4>
<p>Chief, are you sleep deprived already? If you need to go take care of yourself, we can go over everything later. Weâ€™ve got this. In fact we need you bright eyed and bushy tailed for when things really start going.<br>
<br>Diego snorts and considers what he was just told. Without even looking at Karen he breaks into a light jog toward con-ops.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Nope! I gotta make sure those printers get to reg.<br>
<br>Karen struggles to keep up and yells after him as he gets farther away.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>KAREN</h4>
<p>Diego! We put Hawk there for a reason! Iâ€™m sure he can...<br>
<br>Karen trails off as the Yeen gets further and further away. Karen gives up the pursuit and lets out a deep sigh, looking annoyed and tired. She rests her hands on her knees to catch her breath. Diego yells back at Karen.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Thanks Karen, Youâ€™re the best!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>KAREN</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(panting)</p>

<p>She steps off into a jog again.</p>

<p>Hold on! Would you just--</p>

<h2>MATCH CUT TO:</h2>
<h3>INT. AIRPLANE #2 - DAY</h3>
<p>Thistle rushs down another terminal corridor.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Wait!</p>
</div>
<p>FLIGHT ATTENDANT #2 is about to shut the door when they stop and pull it open for Thistle. He nearly runs into them as he passes the doorway in a hurry.</p>
<p>Catching his breath, he turns into the plane. He hustles along the aisles, reading his boarding pass and scans the seating numbers. Most of the seats are already filled.</p>
<p>He plops down into an aisle seat, panting. DAVID, an aged viper with piercing two-toned eyes in the seat next to him, glares down at Thistle cautiously. Thistle opens his eyes and scans the area, growing frantic. David leans away from him.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>My bag! I left my bag! Oh nooooo!</p>
</div>
<p>David sighs and rolls his eyes.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DAVID</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(under his breath)</p>
<p>I've had it with thessse mother cussssing dogs, on thessse mother cussssing planesss.</p>
</div>
<p>Leaning back in his seat, Thistle swallows hard and takes a deep breath.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(to himself)</p>
<p>I can't be late.</p>
</div>
<h2>DISSOLVE TO:</h2>
<p>Thistle snacks on a cracker while watching out the window. A bell overhead sounds. He looks up at it, still chewing. He looks across the aisle at another passenger who has taken out their device. Thistle swallows, dusts his fingers, pulls out his phone, and types out a message.</p>
<p>Clover's notification sounds.</p>
<h3>INT. GAS STATION - DAY</h3>
<p>Clover stands behind an old sheep lady in line, he carries a soda and sunflower seeds. He pulls the phone from his pocket and scans it. Sahny steps up behind him, carrying an aggressive energy drink and a cylinder of chips. Baz holds a large drink can of tea and a box of cookies. He turns to the two of them.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Looks like Thistle's flights were delayed. He'll probably be arriving about the same time as us. So I'll drop you two off then pick him up.</p>
</div>
<p>His phone chimes again, they step up to the cashier as the old sheep shuffles out of the line. Clover reads his phone and clicks his tongue.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Tsk. Ah, man, poor guy lost his bag on one of the flights too.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Oh no! I've done that one before.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Not me. I never forget anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Oh, so you remembered to bring your wallet this time?</p>
</div>
<p>Sahny bashfully dips their head.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(sheepish)</p>
<p>No, I got it.</p>
</div>
<p>Velcro rips as Baz opens the top flap of her messenger bag, she rummages through it. Clover lightly presses his fingers against her arm. She stops and looks at him. He slides the tea and cookies next to his items. Baz smiles and mouths "Thank you".</p>
<h3>INT. CLOVER'S SUV - DAY</h3>
<p>Baz, Sahny, and Clover exit the gas station with their snacks in hand, and climb into the SUV. In the rear view mirror, Clover watches Sahny struggle to settle down between a fursuit bin and wine boxes.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>You gonna be able to buckle up with all that junk?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Good, 'cause we can always throw out the wine.</p>
</div>
<p>Sahny blows raspberries as they shimmy into a spot and buckle in.</p>
<p>The SUV creaks as it takes the slight dip out of the parking lot and onto the road.</p>
<h2>DISSOLVE TO:</h2>
<p>Baz doodles on her phone, Clover relaxed at the wheel. She lowers her phone.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Hey! This will be the first time you'll be meeting Thistle, yeah?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Yup.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Bit exciting.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
</div>
<p>Baz scratches the top of her snout with the stylus, looks out the window at the passing scenery.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>You ready for that?</p>
</div>
<p>Clover glances out the side window through the corner of his eye.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(hesitant)</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
</div>
<p>Baz looks up at him for a moment, then turns her attention back to her phone doodle.</p>
<h2>DISSOLVE TO:</h2>
<p>Sahny watches the scenery out one window, Baz out the other.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Okay, my turn! I spy something ... dead.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Sahny, again the plants aren't dead. They're just the color ... dead.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>
<span class="italic">Dead</span> is not a color!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Fine, I spy something brownish-gray.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Everything out here is brown. Pick something else!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Maybe we should <span class="italic">play</span> something else.</p>
</div>
<h2>DISSOLVE TO:</h2>
<p>Sahny's feet press against the car door as they lay in the crowded bench seat, playing some game on their phone. Clover quickly looks toward Baz and clears his throat.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>So, how's your art been going?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Eh, it's going.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>I hope so. I love my eagle badge. Brought it with me too!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Sorry I had ship it. They didnâ€™t bend it in the post, I hope?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(chuckles)</p>
<p>Nah, I think they took extra care because of all the drawings you did all over the envelope.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Aww, I'm so glad!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Wish you had said something, though. I couldâ€™ve swung by and saved you the postage!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Iâ€™ve been so caught up, it was the easiest way to get it to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>You get a lot of commissions?</p>
</div>
<p>Baz lowers her phone. Biting her lip, she looks out the window.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Oh, not as much as I'd like.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Yeah? You doin' alright?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(hesitant)</p>
<p>Yeah, I'll do alright. Just a tad skint for the moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(shocked, whispering)</p>
<p>Wait, you're broke?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(sheepish)</p>
<p>No! Not totally.</p>
</div>
<p>Sahny lowers their phone to their chest.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Tsh, you both have problems! Gotta be more like me, live it day by day. Savor. Every. Moment.</p>
</div>
<p>Sahny sits up and leans into the front. Taking in a big breath through their snoot, smiling wide.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(growling)</p>
<p>Sahny! Don't be rude!</p>
</div>
<p>Sahny's smiles fades as they sink back into the seat, cowing their head.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(pouting)</p>
<p>Sorry, Baz.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>That's alright, Sahny. Read you're going to be in the dance comp again, yeah?</p>
</div>
<p>Sahny mumbles something affirmative as they hide their face in the phone.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>How long you been competing?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(pouting)</p>
<p>Too long to still be second rate.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Don't beat yourself up.</p>
</div>
<p>Baz grins then throws up her fists in mock fisticuffs.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(faking a deep voice)</p>
<p>Let me do it!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(lunging forward)</p>
<p>You wanna go?! I'll take you out!</p>
</div>
<p>Everyone laughs. Clover shakes his head with a big smile.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>You two are nuts!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Break you too, gray muzz!</p>
</div>
<p>Sahny lets out a little hyena giggle. All the laughs fads. Baz turns back to Sahny.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>You're gonna win this year, tho. Yeah?</p>
</div>
<p>Sahny nods.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Yee.</p>
</div>
<p>Baz nods, then turns back to look out the window.</p>
<p>( MUSIC : "REG LINE" )</p>
<p>Several landscapes fade in and out as the SUV drives down the long stretch of road. The sun disappears and the sky fades to night. The guitar strums in for "REG LINE". Sahny turns around in the seat and grins at the fursuit head facing out the rear window. Baz yawns and stretches in the seat. Clover bobs his head to the music.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>On the road, gonna beat the traffic.<br>There isn't much at 4am.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing, annoyed)</p>
<p>I can hardly move inside this car.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing, blissful)</p>
<p>In the back you can see "the magic",<br>Mesh eyes starin' back towards home.<br>800 miles can't be that far.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER AND SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>What is this our fifth con this year?<br>I bet they already got our spot saved, in the...<br>Reg line!<br>Where they'll need to know what's your name and...<br>Do you have your ID?<br>Reg line!<br>Get your badge and goooooo, make the con your own!</p>
</div>
<p>The SUV rounds a bend in the freeway. Through the windshield, just beyond a set of trees, the F.U.R.S on the horizon glistens in the setting sun. Sahny points to it from the back seat. Baz looks up from her phone.</p>
<h3>INT. AIRPORT #2 - DAY</h3>
<p>Thistle stands in a queue, lined up to behind the ticket checker to board the flight. He advances little by little with the song advancement.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>FLIGHT ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.)</h4>
<p>Now boarding, flight three-oh-five for Reno, Nevada.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>Got a two-hour delay sitting at the airport.<br>But, weather ain't breakin' this smile.<br>This'll be my first time off of the ground.</p>
</div>
<p>Thistle counts on his fingers, as if to list off each line in the follow verse.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Call Jesse as I hit arrivals.<br>Countdown till the moment we meet.<br>I step out at door two and I see their car.<br>Trunk clicks open, stick my bag inside.<br>Now it's only us for a thirteen-minute ride.</p>
</div>
<h3>EXT. RENO AIRPORT PICKUP - NIGHT</h3>
<p>Clover's car is parked outside of pickup in the Reno Airport. Thistle sets his bag down inside the cabin, and leans his head in.</p>
<p>Clover sits behind the wheel, he reaches out a hand toward Thistle.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Hi, I'm Jesse -- er, Clover.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Thanks for picking me up, I'm -- ha! I guess you know me as Thistle. Well, where should we go first?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Do you have your badge yet?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>No.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Well...</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>Take me to the Reg line!<br>Gotta get my alter-ego's identification.<br>Reg Line!<br>Get my badge and gooooo<br>
</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(spoken)</p>
<p>... find my hotel room.</p>
</div>
<p>The SUV door shuts and they drive away.</p>
<h3>INT. REGISTRATION ROOM - NIGHT</h3>
<p>Droves of animal folk in all different shapes, sizes, and colors form several queues in front of tables with volunteers taking their identification in exchange for a conference badge.</p>
<p>A handful even get a bag of swag given to them. DASH, a slender, griffin male with a RADIO on his shoulder, hurries alongside Diego behind the registration tables. Diego is dressed up in a satiny purple dress shirt, black button up vest and shiny slacks with a chain hanging from the back pocket.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(annoyed)</p>
<p>Ugh, we've had some lights down and an elevator.<br>So far nothing to scrape off the walls.<br>I wish we could get ONE thing to start on time!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>RADIO</h4>
<p>Calling con-chair.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>Here's my next disaster!</p>
</div>
<p>Diego grabs the radio off Dash's shoulder, and speaks into it. The cord attached to the radio tugs Dash along as Diego quickly turns around.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing, to radio)</p>
<p>What do you MEAN "the system's down"?<br>
</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(spoken, to radio)</p>
<p>Ugh... just start writing it down.<br>
</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>And we'll put it all in later!<br>The con has barely started and we're nearly undone.<br>Did we rent a damn piano?<br>Seems the only thing that's moving is the...<br>
</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(pause. exaggerated breath)</p>
<p>Reg line!</p>
</div>
<p>The registrants join in, dancing from their place in line, around the ropes separating the lines.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>REGISTRANTS</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>Reg Line!<br>Tell your friends you're heading down.<br>And where they can meet you is the Reg Line!<br>Better get yourself into a suit, and stand still for hours.<br>Reg Line!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>Just behind the -- ooh, I'm really not sure where it is.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>REGISTRANTS</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(singing)</p>
<p>Reg Line!<br>Get yourself a bunch of stuff to forget in your hotel room.<br>Reg Line!<br>Reg Line!<br>Reg Line!<br>Reg Line!<br>AAAAHHH!!!<br>Reg Line!</p>
</div>
<p>The volunteers and the registrants return to the positions they were a moment ago.</p>
<p>( END: "REG LINE" )</p>
<p>Diego attempts to put the radio back on Dash's shoulder mount. After a few attempts, he flings the loose cord over Dash's head and rests the radio on his shoulder. Diego nods and turns away. Dash continues on, fixing his radio. Diego looks out on the moving registration line.</p>
<p>Clover and Thistle join in the back of the registration line.</p>
<p>Diego squints and tilts his head a bit.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(to himself)</p>
<p>The heck, is that Clover?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>VOLUNTEER (O.S.)</h4>
<p>Hey Diego, can you look at this?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>What now?</p>
</div>
<p>Diego rushes out of the room.</p>
<p>Standing in the midst of the line, Thistle's tail wags erratically as he lists off to Clover from his phone.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(excited)</p>
<p>Then, we have forty-three minutes to eat, before the next panel. That goes until two-thirty, but if we hurry, we'll make it to a cool dragon panel! Oh, it's gonna be so much fun!</p>
</div>
<p>Thistle sighs contently, catching his breath, and leans his head against Clover.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>You must be tired from all those flights. Why'd you take so many?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Oh! I planned out the trip myself. I took different airlines so I could arrive the quickest. It was cheaper too.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Hmm, nice! Bummer about your bag though. They can probably mail it back to ya. We'll get you some clothes for the weekend.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>That would be great! Maybe we could get something you'd like to see on me.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(bashful)</p>
<p>Uhh, sure.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>KING (O.S.)</h4>
<p>Alright, reg is closing!</p>
</div>
<p>Met with groans from the crowd, KING, a lion with a large neon green dyed mane, shouts to the crowd.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>KING</h4>
<p>We're taking five more people tonight!</p>
</div>
<p>Thistle counts the people in front of them in line. He whips his head to Clover.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(whining)</p>
<p>Nooo! We were too late! This is awful! They don't open until ten tomorrow! And we're going to miss the first panel! And we're...</p>
</div>
<p>Thistle carries on as he turns into Clover's side and becomes muffled and incoherent.</p>
<p>King approaches the bear and hands him two tickets. Still falling apart against his taller companion, Thistle misses a short inaudible conversation between the lion and the bear.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>KING</h4>
<p>Now get some rest, Iâ€™m sure you still got that staffâ€™s <span class="italic">sleep deficit</span>, right?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Been at it for over a year. Maybe one day Iâ€™ll catch up!</p>
</div>
<p>King laughs and turns to walk away. She waves and he waves back with his free hand.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Iâ€™m glad to see you in one piece. Thanks again for the assist!</p>
</div>
<p>Focusing again on Thistle, Clover brushes the tiny dog's cheek fluff with the tickets. Thistle peeks an eye out to see, his ears perk.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Oh whoa, what's this, Jess-- I uh, Clover?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>
<span class="italic">These</span> are so we can cut in line tomorrow.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(excited)</p>
<p>Oh, really?! That's gonna be great! Then, we can be the first in line. Grab our stuff and go to the panel. We'll be a little late, but should catch the interesting parts.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Alright, alright. It sounds like a busy day planned. Let's check in and head up to the room. See what the others are up to.</p>
</div>
<h3>INT. THE GUEST ROOM - NIGHT</h3>
<p>A modern design decorates a double queen hotel guest room. Through the window, the technicolor downtown Reno skyline gleams against the silhouette of the mountain in the distance. Baz draws at a small table in the corner. She doesn't notice as Clover and Thistle walk into the room.</p>
<p>Tossing a dusty duffel bag on the floor, Clover clears his throat. To which, Baz looks up from her sketchbook.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Oh, 'sup guys!</p>
</div>
<p>Baz sets her sketchbook aside and stands up. Thistle reaches out a hand to Baz. She looks at his hand, chuckles, and shakes it.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Hi, I'm Thistle.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>What, I thought you liked hugs?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Oh, I do!</p>
</div>
<p>Baz spreads her arms out for a hug.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Well, just gotta ask!</p>
</div>
<p>Thistle gives Baz a gentle hug. She backs up and looks at his "Good Boix" shirt.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Nice shirt.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>I love this shirt! It's the best! Thank you so much for sending it to me!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>I got the idea from you. I'm just glad you like it.<br>
</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(looking off to the side)</p>
<p>Nobody else really seems to.</p>
</div>
<p>A faint alarm sounds. Thistle's hand dives into his pocket. Whipping out his phone, he flicks the screen. The alarm stops.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Bedtime?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(stretching with a goofy grin)</p>
<p>Mm-hmm!</p>
</div>
<p>Thistle crawls under the covers, shuffles around, and his footpaw pushes out his pants which thump on the floor. A lump under the covers spins around three times, then flops completely still. A moment later, little snores emit from the bedding.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(smiling)</p>
<p>Wow. Zonked out like that, yeah?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Poor little guy, he's been flying all day.<br>
</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(yawning)</p>
<p>And, we've been driving all day.</p>
</div>
<p>Baz's stomach growls and she claps a gloved hand on her abdomen.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Oof, and I forgot to eat all day.</p>
</div>
<p>Clover gives her a look of mild disappoint.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(defensive)</p>
<p>What, I was working! Setting up my table ... and stuff...</p>
</div>
<p>Baz places her hand on her arm and stares off to the side as her words trail off. Passed a raised eyebrow, Clover looks her over. With a sigh, he turns his glare into a sympathetic gaze.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>I'm sure you'll do fine.</p>
</div>
<p>Baz rubs her palms into her eyes, her ears droop.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Uggghh, I hope so! I'm nervous. I'm tabled next to dauB. He's so <span class="italic">good</span>!</p>
</div>
<p>She drags her hands down her cheeks, stretching and distorting her face.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Oh yeah, his stuff is good.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(groan)</p>
<p>Heâ€™s <span class="italic">too</span> good! I've admired his work for so long! And now he's tabled with me. Ugh!</p>
</div>
<p>She moves her hands back up to squish her cheeks into her eyes, holding her head.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(quiet)</p>
<p>Oy, I'm gonna go broke!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>You'll do fine.</p>
</div>
<p>Baz's stomach growls. Clover smirks.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>As long as you eat.</p>
</div>
<p>She smiles, hugs him. She grabs her sketchbook and messenger bag. Clover rolls out a sleeping bag from his duffel and sits on it. Baz looks down at him.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Not sleeping in the bed?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(shaking his head)</p>
<p>No. Not yet.</p>
</div>
<p>Baz nods and heads towards the door.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Where's Sahny?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Heh. You know that one, they're at...<br>
</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(in air quotes)</p>
<p>
<span class="italic">Whatever's open</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Baz smirks, throws a quick wave, and exits.</p>
<p>Clover lays on his back, staring up at the ceiling. He takes a drawn out deep breath and closes his eyes.</p>
<h2>FADE OUT.</h2>
