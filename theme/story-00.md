<h3>INT. HOTEL MEETING FLOOR - DAY</h3>
<p>The sound of footsteps ring through darkness in a distant echo upon tiled floor. Fade from black to a poorly lit hallway, covered in stained &amp; cracked, off-white tiles. A light overhead flickers. Cobwebs line the corners of the hallway. To one side is some construction equipment, roped off by yellow caution tape.</p>
<p>The footsteps become rhythmic as a set of heels joins in the beat with click-like percussion. Slowly, more varied footsteps join in the rhythm. The jingle of keys adds in the melody.</p>
<p>In a pitch black room, yellow light beams from around a rusted door frame. The footstep rhythm gets louder, faster paced. A shadow slides across the bottom of the door and stops as it fills the frame. The sound of keys jingling, a pause, a clunk of a door lock, the door opens and light creeps into the room.</p>
<p>DIEGO, a wiry, spotted hyena in a black, heavy metal t-shirt, dark baggy pants and all the air of a rock star or stage performer, walks into the room. He drops a set of keys into a chair and a cloud of dust billows from the chair. KAREN, a short, timid looking, trans-female fox in a dress suit and skirt follows Diego into the room. She fans away the dust from her face and flips on the light.</p>
<p>Diego pulls a plastic tarp away from a large meeting table, dust flying everywhere. Karen bends over to let out 3 short sneezes, sniffles, and stands upright.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>KAREN</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(sarcastically)</p>
<p>What a lovely place you've chose to meet...</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(snaps his fingers and points to Karen)</p>
<p>Well...Ya know how the con will go bankrupt soon, if we don't slow growth?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>KAREN</h4>
<p>Yes, I brought it up to you last week...</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Yep, and thank you for that! Well, I have an idea!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>KAREN</h4>
<p>Oh no...</p>
</div>
<p>ROJO, a male husky with brown coloring and a singular flop ear walks into the room. Followed by, HERMES, a male panda bear and DASH, a slender male griffin.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>Hey! Glad you could make it! That's everyone, so listen up! Considering the info we got from Karen and the near incidents we had happen last year due to so few volunteers, I have an idea to make the con more manageable.</p>
</div>
<p>Karen lets out a barely audible sigh. Rolls her eyes up, as to plead to the heavens and mouths "why?"</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO (CONT'D)</h4>
<p>To shrink attendance down to what we can handle, we're holding the con in...wait for it...</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>ROJO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(interrupting, wrinkling his nose)</p>
<p>Here?  You mean...here?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(animated annoyance)</p>
<p>YES ROJO, THANKS FOR RUINING MY THUNDER.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>ROJO</h4>
<p>Oh I'm sorry, I just meant this place is kind of a fixer-upper.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>HERMES</h4>
<p>OH! And you mean to have the con run here, out in the middle of the desert!</p>
</div>
<p>Karen buries her head in her hands.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DASH</h4>
<p>Hey, as long as we can decide where to put reg, I'm not worried.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(listing on his fingers)</p>
<p>Come on guys!  This'll be cheaper, it will make attendance go down, and the rooms are easier to secure.<br>
</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(putting his hands up to emphasize his words)</p>
<p>Because of the security thing last year, the hotel nearly canceled the contract.  FURSUASION NEARLY DIDN'T HAPPEN!  WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>ROJO</h4>
<p>I don't like it, but if I need to sleep in the dealer's den again I will!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>HERMES</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(concerned)</p>
<p>Yeah I remember that, I was pulling fur out when the hotel tried to cancel.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>KAREN</h4>
<p>It's unreasonable to ask our volunteers to just go to a different location every few years.  We might lose more.  Plus this place is terrible!</p>
</div>
<p>Diego sighs.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>That's the point.  Oh!  Karen, I also think we should raise the price slightly, that should help recoup our losses, I don't want to lose my house too.</p>
</div>
<p>Karen sighs and looks with sympathy at Diego.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>KAREN</h4>
<p>Diego...This sounds like a really terrible idea. This might just kill it.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>DIEGO</h4>
<p>As far as I see it, it's dead anyway...</p>
</div>
<h2>FADE TO:</h2>
<h3>INT. CLOVER'S KITCHEN - DAY</h3>
<p>A burst of blue flame ignites on a range top. The flame calms and shrinks.</p>
<p>CLOVER, a male polar bear of average build, sets a lidded stockpot over the flame. He leans against the stove, stirring a second pot. With his free hand, he adjusts an apron that reads "Bear-y good cook". The apron clashes with a Hawaiian shirt and faded slacks.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(over his shoulder)</p>
<p>Just ten more minutes. How've things been at the art store?</p>
</div>
<p>A pencil glides across a page of smooth bristol. A few more confident strokes are drawn out to reveal a cartoonish horse chowing down on a huge plate of spaghetti. A slender sergal woman with gray fur dressed in colorful clothes wrapped with a poofy letterman jacket. BAZ holds up the sketchbook, twists it at various angles. She glances over to Clover and then back to her work, then smiles with approval.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Oh that place? New management has been an absolute nightmare, so I quit. It was the push I needed. I've been meaning to go full time with my art.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Oh? You've got a couple months cushion in your savings, right?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(nervous chuckle)</p>
<p>Yeah, I should be fine...</p>
</div>
<p>Baz sinks slowly into her chair and "turtles" inside her oversized jacket. Clover sighs and looks like he's about to say something, but stops as the door bursts open and slams with a crack against the wall behind it. A figure falls through the door and thuds on the ground.</p>
<p>SAHNY, a non-binary hyena jumps up, rubbing a hand through dyed-red, unkempt hair. A big smile of astonishment on their face.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Oh! Wow! You finally kept it unlocked! Glad I didn't run into it again.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(sarcastically)</p>
<p>I don't keep my door unlocked all the time... just for you... <br>
</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(under his breath)</p>
<p>And my door...</p>
</div>
<p>Clover walks around the corner of the kitchen archway, wiping his hands on a hand towel. Hanging up their designer jacket, Sahny looks over at Clover and nearly doubles over with laughter. Clover looks down at his apron.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(in between laughs)</p>
<p>Oh my goodness! You... you actually wore the apron! The look you gave me... Man, I thought you'd burned it by now! Woo! You hilarious old man!</p>
</div>
<p>Clover blushes and turns back to the kitchen, Sahny follows.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(over his shoulder)</p>
<p>Dinner's almost ready. Why don't you set the table since you're late?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(sing-songy)</p>
<p>I prefer the term "fashionably late".</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>I don't understand how you can be late, you live closer than Baz.</p>
</div>
<p>Sahny sets down plates and silverware. Baz not looking up from her sketchbook, scoots the sketchbook out of the way as Sahny sets down a plate in front of her. Baz looks up at Sahny.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Hey, Sahny.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Hey.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Nice, shirt.</p>
</div>
<p>Sahny stretches out a baggy, red shirt with a stylized symbol of a Sergal head printed on it.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Ahhhh, yeeeeah! Bought 'em soon as you put 'em up.</p>
</div>
<p>Clover lugs over the large stockpot to the table. His bear nose wiggles as he spoons out a helping of spaghetti onto Baz's plate,  then hands the spoon to Sahny. Clover pulls his phone from his pocket and fumbles at the screen. Sahny looks between him and the phone, they set down the spoon and gesture toward the phone. Clover rolls his eyes, sighs, and hands over the phone. Clover sets down at the head of the table, spoons himself some spaghetti. He picks up his fork, goes to take a bite, glances at Baz still sketching away. He nudges her with his elbow. She looks up at him and to the spaghetti, setting her sketchbook aside.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE (ON PHONE)</h4>
<p>Oh, Hi Sahny! How are you?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Hey Thistle.</p>
</div>
<p>Sahny places the phone against a vacant seating. THISTLE, a white shepherd mix with large, youthful eyes, appears on the screen frantically waving at everyone.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Hi guys! Great, you were able to do dinner! I was worried I was gonna be late, my schedule said eight pm sharp but I wasn't able to get out of work until eight fifteen. What'd you make tonight Big D.?</p>
</div>
<p>Sahny snorts by stifling back the full bite of spaghetti and swallows it hard.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>"Big D."? OH NO. Don't tell me he calls yo--</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(excitedly)</p>
<p>It's short for big daddy! I came up with that today at work.</p>
</div>
<p>Clover covers his mouth with a napkin, his eyes filled with embarrassment. Sahny's fork clatters against the plate. Sahny slaps the table and kicks their legs in a fit of laughter.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(giggling)</p>
<p>I'm crying... THERE ARE TEARS... I CAN'T BREATHE...</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>What...? I... Did I miss something?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(swallowing)</p>
<p>Thistle, you're on the east coast, right? Did you go to AnthroFuzz?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>No? What's that?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(clears throat)</p>
<p>That's a furry convention near you. Um... It's where a bunch of folk gather to dress in fursuits and hangout. The three of us go to a handful a year.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Oooh, yeah! Fursuasion is next up! Best. Room. Parties. EVER!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Oh? That sounds amazing! Are you going to that one, Big Daddy?</p>
</div>
<p>Sahny falls out of the chair laughing. Baz raises and eyebrow towards Sahny as she takes a bite. Clover wipes his mouth.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY (UNDER THE TABLE)</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(between laughter)</p>
<p>I... I... legit... can't even!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(over Sahnny's giggles)</p>
<p>Yeah, go every year. I used to volunteer there, but they keep moving it around.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(to Clover)</p>
<p>Oh, speaking of which, we do have a spare spot in our room. Maybe Thistle could fit?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>CAN I?! Oh, Big Da--</p>
</div>
<p>A loud thunk against the underside of the table. Everyone look down towards Sahny's empty place setting.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE (CONT.)</h4>
<p>Uhh...Clover, what do you think? I can search for the best flight. When do you guys arrive? It's gonna be so cool to meet you all in person!</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>We all drive together. Probably to arrive...mmm. Thursday of-con.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>You should pre-reg now, the prices are pretty good.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Thank you! I'm not worried about money too much.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(sing-songy, while sipping water)</p>
<p>Lucky</p>
</div>
<p>A faint alarm sounds over on Thistle's side of the phone.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Oh, goodness! Time to get ready for bed.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(muttering)</p>
<p>You schedule your sleep?</p>
</div>
<p>Sahny sits back into the seat, while wiping away tears. Baz leers at Sahny, shakes her head slightly, mouths "Grow up". Sahny sticks their tongue out at Baz.</p>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>CLOVER</h4>
<p>Okay, Thistle! Good night, bud.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(to Clover)</p>
<p>Don't you mean "Li'l D."?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>No, that wouldn't work. I'm just Good Boy. Good Boy, LaCroix.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p class="parenthetical">(smiling)</p>
<p>Wuh? That's adorable.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>I should go too. Thanks for the grub, old man!<br>
</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(implying someone special)</p>
<p>Celeste is waiting for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>BAZ</h4>
<p>Your... cat?</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>SAHNY</h4>
<p>Yeah, gurrrl.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<h4>THISTLE</h4>
<p>Good night everyone!</p>
</div>
<p>BAZ, SAHNY, CLOVER<br>Okay, good night!</p>
<p>Clover hoists the pot back into the kitchen. Sahny clears the plates. Baz packs up her sketchbook.</p>
