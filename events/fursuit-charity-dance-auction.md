## About

Expect music, dancing, showcasing our fursuiters available for auction and most importantly fun as we raise money for charity. There will be individuals up for bid as well as the potential for pairs or groups of fursuiters to bid on. Do not feel like you have to bid alone. Get some friends and pool your money to bid! In return for a successful bid all we are asking is that the suiter(s) show their bidding partner(s) a good time on the dance floor for the first hour. There are no other expectations or obligations. No inappropriate or lewd acts will be implied to get bids on the stage, and the same will not be tolerated from any bidders. This entire event is good, clean fun for charity and we intend to keep it that way. All proceeds will go towards <a href="/charity/">our charity</a>.

## What We're Looking For

Full fursuits are preferred, though partials will be considered as well. Fursuiters of any gender/agender are welcomed, we only ask that all suiters are comfortable dancing with anyone, as bidding will not be restrictive to specific attendees.

Suiters do not need to be a great dancer to apply. Just willing to have a great time and able to devote the first hour of the dance to their bidder on the dance floor. The people bidding are donating to the convention's charity, and we want them to be happy to have done so.

Fursuit Bachelor(ettes)s will be required to show up to the Fursuit Dance Auction and the dance on time. There will be a period of time between the auction and the dance to give all suiters time to prepare and enjoy the con. They will also be allowed to break to the headless lounge during the dance to cool off and hydrate. It really shouldn't be any different then if they were attending the dance normally, except they'll have an escort with them to dance with.
