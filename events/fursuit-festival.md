## About the Festival

We are excited to bring back the Fursuit Festival! This year **on Friday**, after the Dealer’s Den closes, we will be launching with our giant group fursuit photo in Main Stage at **7:20pm** SHARP and then fill both the main stage and second stage areas with tons of photo shoot areas and activities for everyone to enjoy! Here's how the evening will work:

### Big Group Photo

The Festival will be Friday evening, starting **7PM** and going until **9PM**. Suiters can begin staging at **6:30PM** in Second Stage (Grand Ballroom), but there won’t be any special fursuit tag giveaways so there’s no need to fall in line – just show up!

### Photo stations

There will be six dedicated photo stations for scheduled photo shoots. There's also an impromptu photo station again this year, so even if you’re not on the schedule, you can still get the red carpet treatment! To get a group photo at the impromptu station, just assemble your group and walk right up!

### A Tale of Two Rooms

This year, all photo shoots will be in Main Stage, keeping the Grand Ballroom free for activities and games. Plenty of space for fursuiters, photographers, and other people to freely wander and mingle!

### Open to the Public

After the giant group fursuit photo, the festival begins! Suiters and non-suiters mingle across both rooms, creating lots of great interaction opportunities for fursuiters, which means all the one-on-one interaction time you can get without needing to keep up with a parade line!
