# About the Festival

We are excited to bring back the Fursuit Festival! This year **on Friday**, after the Dealer’s Den closes, we will be launching with our giant group fursuit photo in Main Stage at **7:20pm** SHARP and then fill both the main stage and second stage areas with tons of photo shoot areas and activities for everyone to enjoy! Here's how the evening will work:

### Big Group Photo

The Festival will be Friday evening, starting **7PM** and going until **9PM**. Suiters can begin staging at **6:30PM** in Second Stage (Grand Ballroom), but there won’t be any special fursuit tag giveaways so there’s no need to fall in line – just show up!

### Photo stations

There will be six dedicated photo stations for scheduled photo shoots. There's also an impromptu photo station again this year, so even if you’re not on the schedule, you can still get the red carpet treatment! To get a group photo at the impromptu station, just assemble your group and walk right up!

### A Tale of Two Rooms

This year, all photo shoots will be in Main Stage, keeping the Grand Ballroom free for activities and games. Plenty of space for fursuiters, photographers, and other people to freely wander and mingle!

### Open to the Public

After the giant group fursuit photo, the festival begins! Suiters and non-suiters mingle across both rooms, creating lots of great interaction opportunities for fursuiters, which means all the one-on-one interaction time you can get without needing to keep up with a parade line!

<div class="accordion-list">

On Friday
: The festival will be on FRIDAY from 6:30PM until 9PM.

Keeping You Safe
: Security will be present around spaces still restricted to con attendees only, such as the fursuit lounge or video game room.

Lots of Activities
: You’ll see a lot of your favorite activities from last year returning, as well as a few new stations to try out. Be sure to stop by all of them to enjoy playing with all of your suiting and non-suiting friends – but please don’t take any props with you!

Info Stations
: Not sure of where a photo station is or when a particular photo shoot is happening? There will now be information stations available in the main ballroom, second stage area, and fursuit lounge, that will hold lots of useful information to help you plan your festival schedule! We will also have team members from Con Ops floating around able to answer your questions live, and big paper copies of the photo schedule hung up around the rooms.

So Many Fans
: Powerful fans will be scattered around the Festival, for a quick refresher without having to use the fursuit lounge.

Accessible Fursuit Lounges
: There will be two fursuit lounges available - The main fursuit lounge by second stage, and part of backstage behind main stage will be available as well. But these areas will still be very busy; please keep your visits as brief as you can to make room for others who need it.

No more lines
: This year, we eliminated any reason to form a line: There is no special fursuit tag giveaway. You can mingle in Second Stage if you like until the group photo time. Non-suiters simply mingle in Second Stage until the photo is taken.
