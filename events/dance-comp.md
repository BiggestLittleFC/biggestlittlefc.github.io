<div class="one_full"><h2><span>Audition Process</span></h2><div class="page-wrapper"><p>The audition process will work the same as it has in previous years. Competitors will be performing their entire routines for three judges. All performers will be scored using the same system, and the best 20 to 25 acts will advance to the finals. Upon entering, you'll be expected to pick a time during the audition process that you'd like to show up at, that best fits your schedule. If no time works for you, you'll be allowed to send us a video audition. Please make sure your video audition is only unlisted, and not private.</p>

<div class="chunk-accordion"><h3 class="accordion-title">Be respectful!</h3><div class="accordion-content" style="display: none;"><p>Treat your other competitors with respect, as well as the staff running the competition. If you ever have a disagreement, always discuss it politely; it’s not that serious, after all.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="chunk-accordion"><h3 class="accordion-title">What you perform in the preliminaries must be what you intend to perform for the actual show!</h3><div class="accordion-content" style="display: none;"><p> This allows our prelim judges to make the most informed decision in choosing the best acts for the stage.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="chunk-accordion"><h3 class="accordion-title">Submit your music ahead of time.</h3><div class="accordion-content" style="display: none;"><p>All entries must have music for their routine, submitted with your entry form. Music selections should be ready to play for your final performance, in .MP3 format, and at least 256kbps.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="chunk-accordion"><h3 class="accordion-title">Solo routines can not be longer than 2 minutes, and all routines must be at least 1:30</h3><div class="accordion-content" style="display: none;"><p>Routines not edited to be 2 minutes or under will be faded out. We encourage custom edits or mixes and recommend you choose themed music that compliments your routine.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="chunk-accordion"><h3 class="accordion-title">Groups are allowed to add 30 seconds to this per additional member</h3><div class="accordion-content" style="display: none;"><p> As an example, 2 members get 2:30 and can go as long as 4 minutes if they have 5 or more members.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="chunk-accordion"><h3 class="accordion-title">Keep it clean!</h3><div class="accordion-content" style="display: none;"><p>  People of all ages will be watching and listening. Don’t go overboard with any vulgar content in your performance.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="chunk-accordion"><h3 class="accordion-title">Sick/Nervous Group Member? The show can go on.</h3><div class="accordion-content" style="display: none;"><p> Groups who qualify for finals may substitute or drop one individual in finals as long as it affects less than half the group.  (ie. a 2 person group must find a substitute in case one person cannot perform).</p>
</div></div>

<div class="chunk-accordion"><h3 class="accordion-title">Have fun!</h3><div class="accordion-content" style="display: none;"><p> In the end, remember most of all: This is just for fun!
