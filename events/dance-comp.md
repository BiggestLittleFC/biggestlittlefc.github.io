## Judging Criteria

{::comment}During both the preliminaries and the main stage event, judges will be using the **ballroom system**, wherein competitors are ranked against each other in real-time, to make sure no one is forgotten about in the decision making process.{:/comment}

These are some of the aspects our judges will be looking for; some judges consider different aspects more important than others!
  
**Foundation**
  - Your **musicality**; how well the character of the dance/choreo fits or emphasizes the character of the music.
  - Your **flow**; How well do you transition from one part of your performance to the next?
  - Your **execution**; the cleanliness of your moves.

**Variety**
  - The **diversity** of the moves in your performance.
  - Your **tempo**; Are you dancing at the same speed the entire time, or changing it up occasionally?
  - Your **levels**; The use of your y axis. Are you changing up your stance while performing your moves? (Standing, jumping, bending, crouching, being on the floor, etc.)

**Technique**
  - The **complexity** and **finesse** of your moves.
  - **Travelling**. When navigating the stage, are you employing any footwork (spinning, gliding, housing, leaping, etc.) or merely walking around?

## Dance Comp Rules

<div class="accordion-list">

Audition Process
: Competitors will be performing their entire routines for three judges.
  All performers will be scored using the same system, and the best 20 to 25 acts will advance to the finals.
  Upon entering, you'll be expected to pick a time during the audition process that you'd like to show up at, that best fits your schedule.

Categories
: There are two categories - Solo &amp; Group acts

Show up an hour before showtime
: Please show up **one hour before showtime**. That means show up {{ page.times.showup }}.

Eligibility Requirements
: All entries must have music for their routine, submitted with your entry form.
  Sorry, we will not take submissions at the convention.

What you perform in the preliminaries must be what you intend to perform for the actual show!
: This allows our prelim judges to make the most informed decision in choosing the best acts for the stage.

Submit your music ahead of time.
: All entries must have music for their routine, submitted with your entry form. Music selections should be ready to play for your final performance, in .MP3 format, and at least 256kbps.

Solo routines can not be longer than 2 minutes, and all routines must be at least 1:30
: Routines not edited to be 2 minutes or under will be faded out. We encourage custom edits or mixes and recommend you choose themed music that compliments your routine.

Groups are allowed to add 30 seconds to this per additional member
: As an example, 2 members get 2:30 and can go as long as 4 minutes if they have 5 or more members.

Fursuiters only.
: This is a Fursuit dance competition after all!
  You need a head, hand paws, foot paws or costume shoes, and a tail to enter.
  If you choose to wear a partial, please make sure you wear clothes that cover your bare skin!

Be respectful!
: Treat your other competitors with respect, as well as the staff running the competition. If you ever have a disagreement, always discuss it politely; it’s not that serious, after all.

Keep it clean!
: Furries of all ages will be watching and listening so make sure the lyrics are radio appropriate. 
  Don’t go overboard with any vulgar content in your performance.

Have fun!
: In the end, remember most of all: This is just for fun! If you don’t get in, don’t get discouraged. We’re all dancers here, and the world is our stage; not just this one. Good luck, and see you out there on the dance floor!

Sick/Nervous Group Member? The show can go on.
: Groups who qualify for finals may substitute or drop one individual in finals as long as it affects less than half the group.  (ie. a 2 person group must find a substitute in case one person cannot perform).
