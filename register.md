Important: Patron and Sponsor are only available until [pre-reg cutoff]. <strong>No upgrades at-con</strong>.

### Why pre-register?

	- SWAG! *(Patron and Sponsor will not be available after [pre-reg cutoff]).*</strong>
	- SWAG! Swag for the current year is exclusive to Patrons and Sponsors for one year and <strong>not sold separately.</strong>
	- Choose your badge art (instead of getting random art)
	- Simpler, faster process at-con

*Important:* Patron and Sponsor are **not available after [pre-reg cutoff]**. Swag and other Patron/Sponsor benefits are available during pre-reg *ONLY*.

Make sure your pre-registration info matches your photo ID; you must use your photo ID to claim your pre-registration. Make sure you pick your favorite badge art before [pre-reg cutoff].

### SWAG!
