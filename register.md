---
If you registered before May 15th, bring your photo ID to pre-reg. If you can't remember, <a href="https://reg.goblfc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click "Did I pre-register?"</a> to find out. Otherwise:

   1. <strong>Before getting in line,</strong> <a class="button" href="https://reg.goblfc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Log in to registration</a> using your smartphone or one of our kiosks to create an account and complete the registration process. If you have an account from a prior year, please re-use it.
   2. Please pay online with a credit card if you can; it makes the lines go faster. We also accept cash.
   3. Enter the line labeled "at-con registration" and get your badge from the cashier.

<small>Boring legal stuff:</small>

	- BLFC reserves the right to revoke your registration (generally only if you violate the code of conduct).
	- By registering, you also agree to be responsible for bids you make in the art show, charity auction, and bachelor auction.

## Pre-Registration

<a class="button aligncenter" href="https://reg.goblfc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pre-register today!</a>

Important: Patron and Sponsor are only available until May 5th. <strong>No upgrades at-con</strong>.

### Why pre-register?

	- SWAG! <strong>(Patron and Sponsor will not be available after May 5th).</strong>
	- SWAG! Swag for the current year is exclusive to Patrons and Sponsors for one year and <strong>not sold separately.</strong>
	- Choose your badge art (instead of getting random art)
	- Simpler, faster process at-con

<strong>Important:</strong> Patron and Sponsor are <strong>not available after May 5th</strong>. Swag and other Patron/Sponsor benefits are available during pre-reg <strong>ONLY</strong>.

Make sure your pre-registration info matches your photo ID; you must use your photo ID to claim your pre-registration. Make sure you pick your favorite badge art before May 5th.

## Swag!

This year, Sponsors get a full-print t-shirt (seen to the right), with print all the way around, front and back!
Patrons also get a "shard containment device" (a backpack cooler), useful for every con you go to!
If you want these swag items, <strong>you must upgrade by May 5th.</strong> No upgrades at-con.
