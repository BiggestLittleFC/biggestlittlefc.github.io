## Pre-Registration

[Pre-register today!][reglink]

**Important**: Patron and Sponsor are only available until {{ page.preregend }}. **No upgrades at-con**.

### Why pre-register?

- Simpler, faster process at-con
- Choose your badge art (instead of getting random art)
- Guaranteed swag (for Patron and Sponsor)

**Important!** Your pre-registration info **must match your photo ID,** so we can make sure the person who buys the badge gets the badge. Make sure you pick your favorite badge art before {{ page.preregend }}.

### SWAG!

Patron and Sponsor are **not available after {{ page.preregend }}**; you cannot upgrade at-con. If you pre-register as Attendee, you can still buy the swag from the con store, *if there is any left*. Pre-registering as Patron/Sponsor *reserves* the swag just for *you*, and you'll pay less than in the con store. It also gets you the other benefits like a chance at free registration for next year, and early badge pickup.

This year's patron-level swag is still being determined.

## FAQ

Click the titles below to expand.

### Boring legal stuff:

- No part of your registration is tax-deductible, not even Patron memberships.
- BLFC reserves the right to revoke your registration (generally only if you violate the code of conduct).
- By registering, you also agree to be responsible for bids you make in the art show, charity auction, and bachelor auction.

<div class="accordion-list">

Under 18 Years Old?
: **16 - 17 years old**

  - A signed, notarized <a href="https://reg.goblfc.org/BLFCParentalConsentForm.pdf" target="_blank">parental consent form</a> is required. *Bring the original, not a copy.*
  - You must bring a photo ID.
  - You do not need to attend with a parent.


  **15 and under**

  - You must attend with a parent, and they must stay with you at all times.
  - The parent must buy a badge.
  - All badges are free for children 15 and under, with a paid parent badge.



Can I still pay online?
: **Please do!** [Log in to registration][reglink] and complete a registration for this year, and then enter the "at-con registration" line when you arrive.

  Each person who pays online makes the registration line go a little bit faster.


Can I pick badge art at-con?
:  **You cannot pick at-con**; you must choose in the pre-registration system.
  You can change your choice until April 30th, so always pick your current favorite from the available choices.


How can I confirm I'm registered?
: Paid registrations are sent a confirmation email, but your spam filter may have eaten it. To check manually, [click "Did I pre-register?"][reglink] to find out.


Will there be one-day registration?
: There are no one-day badges. Instead, the weekend badge price is reduced on Saturday and Sunday.


What is acceptable ID?
: Any government-issued photo I.D. ( Driver's License, State I.D., or Passport ).


Can I get a refund?
: Until March 5th. See "if I can't make it" below.




What if I can't make it?
: If your last registration payment was less than a year ago, you can have the payment forwarded to next year. You can choose to be sent the swag you would have gotten *instead* of having the payment forwarded. If the payment sits for an additional year, you will be sent items for the current year.



Upgrading?
: 
  You can upgrade until April 30th by picking the higher tier in reg, and paying the difference. *Upgrades are not available after that*.
  <!--
  The upgrade window has passed. Only Attendee registrations are now available.
