## Recruit
Recruits are unproven people we haven't worked with yet. If we don't know you yet, you will be a Recruit for at least a year while you prove your reliability. Most Recruits sign up at-con, but if you know you will volunteer, please apply now for a wider choice of hours.
<br>  When you sign up, we will build your schedule around the hours you're willing to volunteer. If we run short on people outside your scheduled times, you may get a phone call asking for help. Responding to our call and helping will count 1.5x time.
<br>  Sometimes, you may end up "idle," waiting for assignment in the volunteer lounge. You're welcome to socialize while waiting, and we'll also try to have some entertainment options in the volunteer lounge. "Idle time" counts 0.5x time.
<br>  Any hours volunteered on Thursday or Monday count 1.5x time.

### Recruit Rewards
  
#### 4 Hours
<ul><li>Love and Adoration</li>
<li> **Early access to hotel booking next year** </li>
<li>Priority for the quiet floor this year (apply on <a href="/hotel/">hotel page</a>)</li>
<li>A special thank-you gift</li>
<li>Two $12 meal vouchers</li></ul>

#### 8 Hours
<ul><li>Two more $12 meal vouchers</li></ul>

#### 12 Hours
<ul><li>Two more $12 meal vouchers, plus either:</li>
<ul><li>A refund of your attendee level badge, **OR** </li>
<li>A ticket to the Sunday night Staff Appreciation Dinner</li></ul></ul>

#### Over 12 Hours
Nothing. This is to discourage recruits from overworking themselves and missing the con.

## Rewards - Staff
Staff are people we know well enough to rely on. For Staff, the success of the convention comes first. Staff have previously proven commitment to their schedule. Staff committing to the 12+ hour level are called upon to help fill unexpected schedule shortfalls, to **"do whatever it takes."**
<br>  **Staff must apply and be approved before the con,** must be known to be reliable, and are usually either people we've worked with before, or well-established staff members from other conventions.
<br>  Staff members don't have to be leads (though leads do have to be staff).
