# HEY BUDDY | THISTLE, SAHNY, CLOVER, BAZ, DAUB

CLOVER
Hey buddy how are ya feeling?

SAHNY
(groggy & annoyed)
Ugh, can we calm it with the clarinets?

CLOVER
(singing)
Hey buddy how are ya feeling?
There's only one answer
Don't you sound self-satisfied
Aren't you quite the romancer

SAHNY
(singing)
My head is splitting, I mean, are you kidding
cuz nobody sleeps in the tub consciously
I think my tail is missing, I can't find my feet and 
you ask how I'm feeling... What did we do last night?

CLOVER
I wasn't there for most of it. Hey, Thistle do you know where their footpaws are?

THISTLE
Oh, are they awake? Heeeeey buddy, how are you feeling?

SAHNY
Ugh!

THISTLE
I got Ê»em right here, but you really don't remember how they got... "Lost"? Well...
(singing)
10 glasses in and some rabbit asks you for a foot race.
I was there begging you not to, there wasn't enough space.
Into the hallway you scream "out of my way!"
Right into a doorway. You crashed in a heap!
Shedding your footpaws you dashed like two outlaws.
You broke at least 4 laws on your way.
outside to "get some air."

SAHNY
Yeah. That sounds like me. Did I win the race?

THISTLE
You both ran in opposite directions. I'd call it a draw.

SAHNY
So, what about my tail?

THISTLE
Oh Baz has that, I think. Baz!

SAHNY
c-could you keep it down please?

THISTLE
-Oh right... sorry.

BAZ
Heeeeeeey! you're up. How are you feelin'?

SAHNY
...Shut up. My tail?

BAZ
AH! Right.
(singing)
Outside the hotel we chilled with the smokers and sweat-ers.
You say "Check out my new dance move!" and everyone scatters.
You started spinning, your tail rips, goes flinging
along with your lunch which splats onto the sidewalk
Luckily your head was left on someone's bed
so that's one less mess that we have to deal with today.
(spoken)
You got a new nickname. "The Hurling Dervish"
(comedic rimshot)
Managed to keep the bodysuit clean somehow. So that's a win.

SAHNY
So where IS my head then?

The door opens and dauB peaks here head into the room.

DAUB
Hey guys! ohoooooh. They in there? Hey buddy ho-

SAHNY
I SWEAR TO GOD, STOP. Where is my head!? Oh.. it's here... under the sink? What?

DAUB
(singing)
I walked you back to your guest room
and then I went searching.
Retracing all of our steps, asking where it was lurking
Some random dog-person had it on his person
could have been much worse if he's put it on.
on his shoulder it perched, he was making a cerberus
I had to snatch it away and be gone.

CLOVER, THISTLE, BAZ, DAUB (TOGETHER)
(singing)
You do the drinking and we'll do the thinking
now drink lots of water while we give our schpeal
we wouldn't be asking if you weren't the ass-king
so tell us buddy.
How. Do. You. Feel?!
