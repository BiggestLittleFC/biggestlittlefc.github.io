# POWER | SAHNY, DIEGO

SAHNY
(singing)
I donʼt know their faces, never learned their names
realized thereʼs a difference between
being in the crowd and being cheered onto the stage

DIEGO
(singing)
Iʼve been climbing ever higher
see my name on every list
guess where all that kindness gets you
begging, wondering what youʼve missed
You need
Power

SAHNY
(singing)
got to have
Power

DIEGO
I used to think like you, be nice, play by the rules, and surely Iʼll get ahead eventually. If I work hard. but it turns out
(singing)
Itʼs not who you know but rather who knows you and if you
wanna cut in line youʼll need view counts,
white knights, con chairs, check marks, free rides...
Gotta get that

SAHNY & DIEGO
(singing)
Power
more and more
Power
Bring me that
Power
Ya gotta have some Power

SAHNY
(singing)
On my own I might be feeble
hardly worth a second glance

DIEGO
(singing)
call me ruthless, call me evil
think youʼll ever change their stance
Youʼre just giving me your

SAHNY & DIEGO
(singing)
Power
I need all the
Power
Power
Gimme all the
Power
