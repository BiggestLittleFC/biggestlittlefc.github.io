CLOVER
What kind of party is this again?

SAHNY
You'll have to be more specific. What's the first room number?

CLOVER
1142

SAHNY

CLOVER
Right behind ya! er... actually, you should probably follow me

SAHNY
Alright. Here. We. GO. 

Sahny knocks three times, the door creaks open. Party noises can be heard inside the room.

SAHNY
'ey!
(singing)
I'm going all out
Bring on the shots
There are no laws if you're wearing paws
and being thots
I got my chalice
and a 3 foot straw
showin'off the only reason
your head should have a moving jaaaaaw
Bring me my glass!

I'm going alright!
I'm going all night!

Next room! This one's the underwear party. Are you wearing underwear?

CLOVER

SAHNY
Good! Me too. In my pocket. Lemme just... get these on...

CLOVER
Over your fursuit? I never got the point of that. How does ADDING clothing somehow make this seem dirty?
