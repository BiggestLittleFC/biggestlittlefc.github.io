# STITCHES | THISTLE

THISTLE
(singing)
Iʼm wakinʼ up to a whole new shade of gray.
Iʼm seein things that might make some run away.
Look at the ears and the eyes, the tail that bobs behind
and tell me
How do you stitch it all up?
How do you stitch it all up?
Iʼd call it "sculpture" but I might understate.
Iʼm tryinʼ hard not to overcompensate.
I feel the jitters as I step into the con space
How can they stitch it all up? How can they stitch it all up?
Iʼm in stitches
Can you take our picture please?
Iʼm in stitches
Is it dramatic to fall onto my knees
Oh my god. Holy crap. Baby this is where itʼs at.
Iʼm in stitches.
I am home at last.
Maybe a partial, or maybe a full suit.
I do believe this is so much more than cute.
Oh wow my favorite dog! Ya think sheʼll notice me?
How can they stitch it all up?
Iʼm glad they switch it all up.
Iʼm in stitches
Seeing everything Iʼve seen
Iʼm in stitches
Itʼs like walking in a dream
Oh my god. Holy crap. Never seen a suit like that!
Iʼm in stitches.. 
(gasp) I think I found my crush.
Look at the colors and shapes. Can you commit and escape?
Was this a custom or an auction?
I wanna know, howʼs the visibility?
Do you need a cooling vest?
Is there padding in the chest?
Oh (giggles) You know what I mean but seriously.
I need one of my oooooooooown.
Iʼm in stitches
Maybe I could try one on
Iʼm in stitches
Pop my head and Iʼll be gone
Oh my god. Holy crap. Itʼs my station and Iʼve been waiting.
Iʼm in stitches.
Iʼm in stitches.
Iʼm in stitcheeeeeeees.
And you canʼt cut me out.
