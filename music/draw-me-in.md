# DRAW ME IN | BAZ, DAUB

BAZ
(singing)
Hand me a pen
Iʼm 'bout a thousand lines away
from getting to bed
but I struggle to care.

DAUB
(singing)
Out from the dark
out of the corner of my eye
I see the spark
that first got me to dare

BAZ & DAUB (TOGETHER)
(singing)
to think out from underneath this pile
of ref sheets still to go
the work seems easier
you make it easier to let go

BAZ & DAUB (TOGETHER)
(singing)
Draw me into (DAUB: Draw me into)
what youʼve got goin on
make me part of (DAUB: Make me part of)
every sketch till we hit dawn
I like money, but prefer your attention
draw me in, itʼs where I want to be drawn

BAZ
Ugh. this guyʼs markings are ridiculous

DAUB
Let me see... Ooh, yeah. What help with the stripes?

BAZ
Please!

DAUB
(singing)
Lucky for us, the zoo doesnʼt close till 3am

BAZ
(singing)
You call that luck?

DAUB
(singing)
beats disturbing your roommates

BAZ
(singing)
true

BAZ & DAUB (TOGETHER)
(singing)
Tell me who would pick this job
or is it the kind of job that picks you

BAZ
(singing)
itʼs time to laminate

DAUB
(singing)
but we could procrastinate

BAZ & DAUB (TOGETHER)
(singing)
as long as Iʼm with you!
Draw me into	(DAUB: Draw me into)
what youʼve got goin on
make me part of 	(DAUB: Make me part of)
every sketch till we hit dawn
I like money, but prefer your attention
draw me in, itʼs where I want to be drawn

DAUB
Alright. So... oh crap. Do you have a hole punch?

BAZ
Yeah! Do you have any badge clips?

DAUB
(singing)
.... Iʼm not the most prepared person.

BAZ
(singing)
hehehe Itʼs fine have some of mine
I really donʼt know how this con would have gone without you.
