Perhaps my expectations aren't realistic
to think that any single conference could defy
a trend a decade long where I rot working retail
and now I'm giving up before it all begins.

One weekend
where I can finally have a say
One weekend
that lets me get out and away so as I
clutch an airline ticket and a suitcase say a prayer for
my one weekend.
One three-day weekend.

One weekend
all it takes to find and make the place you want to live in
One weekend
time enough to find the stuff you're missing out on
One weekend
every issue, every problem, every complication
One weekend
give me just a few more days so I can get my
One weekend. One weekend. One weekend.

I have a problem, with my bank account
buy my commissions. It's what this con is all about
I might get paid this time. Soon they'll all
wait in line for ME this one weekend. One weekend.

One weekend
time to make it back, the flights, the rooms, the gasoline
One weekend
Draw and sketch and sell my soul to pay the bills
One weekend
sure this can be fun but over all this is a business
One weekend
Got I hope you've all been saving up for this one weekend
one weekend.

Don't worry darlin. It'll all be fine.
I've checked every box, this train is runnin', and it's
runnin'on time.

You think all my suits will fit?
If we take out the boxes of wine

H: Hey! I need those!
B: You can take 2.
H: I need all 8 for the game to work!
B: Okay, 4.
H: Ugh! Fine. I can make this work, at least for...

One weekend
Where the guys will turn their heads when they hear
I'm coming
One Weekend
Maybe THIS year you can find your way back to your
bed... ALONE
One Weekend
Reno hasn't gotten over what we did there last year
One Weekend
And you know that we can't wait to do it all again

One weekend. This weekend!
