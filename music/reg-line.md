# REG LINE | CLOVER, SAHNY, ANNOUNCER, THISTLE, BAZ, VOLUNTEER, DIEGO

CLOVER
(singing)
On the road, gonna beat the traffic.
There isnʼt much at 4am

BAZ
(sung, annoyed)
I can hardly move inside this car

SAHNY
(sung, blissful)
In the back you can see "the magic"
Mesh eyes starinʼ back towards home
800 miles canʼt be that far 

CLOVER & SAHNY
(singing)
What is this our fifth con this year?
I bet they already got our spot saved, in the
Reg line, where theyʼll need to know
whatʼs your name and, do you have your ID?
Reg line, get your badge and goooooo,
make the con your own

ANNOUNCER (over radio)
Now boarding flight 305 for Reno, Nevada

THISTLE
(singing)
Got a 2 hour delay sitting at the airport
but weather ainʼt breakinʼ this smile
thisʼll be my first time off of the ground
Call Jesse as I hit arrivals
count down till the moment we meet
I step out at door 2 and I see their car
Trunk clicks open stick my bag inside
now itʼs only us for a 13 minute ride

CLOVER
Hi, Iʼm Jesse – er, Clover.

THISTLE
Thanks for picking me up, Iʼm... ha! I guess you know me as Thistle… Well, where should we go first?

CLOVER
Do you have your badge yet?

THISTLE
No.

CLOVER
Well...

THISTLE
(singing)
Take me to the Reg line
gotta get my alter-egoʼs identification
Reg Line 
get my badge and go, find my...
(spoken)
hotel room

DIEGO
(annoyed) 
Weʼve had, some lights down, and an elevator
so far nothing to scrape off the walls
I wish we could get ONE thing to start on time

VOLUNTEER (OVER RADIO)
Calling con-chair

DIEGO
(singing)
hereʼs my next disaster
What do you MEAN “the systemʼs down”?
(spoken)
Ugh just start writing it down
(singing)
and weʼll put it all in later!
The con has barely started and weʼre nearly undone
Did we rent a damn piano?
Seems the only thing thatʼs moving is the...
(pause. big exaggerated breath in)
Reg line!

ALL
(singing)
Reg Line
tell your friends youʼre heading down, and where they can meet you is the
Reg Line
better get yourself into a suit, and stand still for hours
Reg Line

DIEGO
(singing)
just behind the...
ooh, Iʼm really not sure where it is

ALL
(singing)
Reg Line
get yourself a bunch of stuff to forget in your hotel room
Reg Line
Reg Line
Reg Line
Reg Line
AAAAHHH!!! (huge held chord)
Reg Line!
