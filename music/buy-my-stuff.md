# BUY MY STUFF | BAZ, DAUB

BAZ
(singing)
Iʼve been training for this weekend,
For most of my life
Start out doodling on napkins
When youʼre only 4 or 5
Now anything you bring me
Yes. Anything you want
I can draw it. I can make it
If you can pay the price
God I need a dollar
I need every cent
Find me. Itʼs not hard to find me
So you can
Buy my stuff.
Buy my stuff.
Look into my eyes. Iʼm wishinʼ
Youʼd pick up a big commission
Buy my stuff
Buy my stuff
Sleep is for those of us who are broke.
(spoken)
Hey there I think we may be table-mates
Is that chair mine? 

DAUB
Oh. Yeah. I think so...

BAZ
I guess Iʼm kinda running late

DAUB
Nah, youʼre probably fine

BAZ
(singing)
I really hope to soak up every nickel 
quarter and dime
Things are tight right now, and all that I 
need right now
Is for them to
Buy my stuff
Buy my stuff
Come get some color from our table

DAUB
Is that YOUR linework?

BAZ
(singing)
Yeah. Itʼs how in able, to make ʻem
Buy my stuff
Buy my stuff

DAUB
So... hey, you wanna collab 
some time? 

BAZ
(bashful. blushes)
I...(giggle) yeah, that could be cool

DAUB
Letʼs get a drink.

BAZ
Think the table will be alright?

DAUB
Iʼm sure they wonʼt miss us

BAZ
(singing)
Who is this guy.
Why does he clear my mind.
Gotta get back. Gotta get what I really 
need.
For you to..

BAZ & DAUB (TOGETHER)
(singing)
buy our stuff
Buy our stuff
I mean heh Iʼm up for whatever.
Think we could do better together?
Wonʼt you
Buy our stuff
Buy our stuff
I hope this place closes soon...
