# GOOD CON | CLOVER, THISTLE, BAZ, SAHNY

CLOVER
(singing)
Packed my bags, know I'm forgetting something
Wish I could take you all home, with me
There's a plane. Bound to fly you off to somewhere
back to the inside of my phone.
and I can't stop thinkin, yeah my mind is racin'
why can't I stay here with you?
I'm sad it's over, and I'm glad it happened
but please, please don't say it.
No. I won't say goodbye
and I don't want to hear you say it either
only time can keep us apart now
so I won't say goodbye
but I can tell you
It was a good con
Here we stand, get in line to get out
kinda wish the roads would all be closed
Oh no more darkness. No I have seen the light
and I'll be thinkin' of you, as we crawl back home
and my job is waitin' and these bills need payin' and hey.
I kinda miss the place I'm from
all the pictures we took, and the stuff we're bringin' home
can remind us, can remind us of the good times.
No. I won't say goodbye
and I don't want to hear you say it either
only time can keep us apart now
so I won't say goodbye
but I can tell you
It was a good con

THISTLE
(singing)
One weekend. Time to take a chance
even though it hurts, I'll be better

SAHNY
(singing)
One weekend. Time to tell the world
that you couldn't care less what it thinks

BAZ
(singing)
One weekend. time to live your life
time to let Ê»em in to live it with you

CLOVER
(singing)
One weekend. If you blink you might
miss it soak it in while you got it.

THISTLE, SAHNY, BAZ, CLOVER (TOGETHER)
(singing)
One weekend. Isn't this the life
and I wouldn't change it for no one
One weekend. I could go for at least one more week.... end!
